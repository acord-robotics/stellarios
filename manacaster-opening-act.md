# Manacaster Opening Act
## Scene 1
*The screen fades from black into the command center of a space station, which is actually an extension of a planet. Animated characters run past the you (currently you are in the third-person). A command table[<sup>1</sup>](#1) is in front of you, with small, holographic figures (these are not pixel-art) moving across the top.*<br/>  

<center> CONSOLE CPU<sup>[2](#2)</sup> </center>
<center> "What was that?" </center><br/>

*The screen shakes as one of the spaceships on the table flies off the table.*<br/>
 
<center> OPUS </center>  
<center> "Hi! My name's Opus...sorry we haven't got more time."</center><br/>

*Another crash/shake. Opus looks over his shoulder nervously as another spaceship leaves the dashboard. While the second one is leaving, a loud rumble is heard, and suddenly the first spaceship comes back in on the left side. The middle of the hull is shown to be green, in contrast to the original yellow, and this symbolises the cargo hold is no longer empty. The second ship docks back after a few seconds, and more people are running around, pushing flight suits on, etc [<sup>3</sup>](#3).*  

<center> OPUS </center>
<center> "Anyway...the ship's AI is a little battered. That last battle with the Miydlians cost us dearly, my friend. But the Miydlians suffered even heavier casualties, and we will - we must - persevere."</center><br/>  
 
*A hooded being walks (in contrast to the others) towards Opus. They converse quickly, with their antennaes lighting up - telepathically (no sound or facial movements). Opus shoes the alien away and turns back to the player.* <br/>

<center> OPUS </center>
<center> "Both us and the Miydlians need your help. I'm sending you co-ordinates now for some items you, and your crewmates will pick up. These items - artifacts - are essential for the continuation of our civilization."</center> <br/>

*Opus turns around to the control panel/dashboard and presses some buttons. Suddenly, a hole appears in the ground below your feet and you fall through. Quickly, you are deposited into the cockpit of a star/spaceship and its engines are firing up - you are go!* <br/>

<center> OPUS </center>
<center> "Oh, and one more thing. The enemy took your memories away - we've been nursing you back to health over the last few weeks, in addition to the war we've been winning. They jetisonned a package that looks like an artifact - it may be the stolen memories from our people. That's your primary mission. Good luck, soldier, Midgard thanks you."</center><br/>

*A new bubble appears in your dashboard section of the HUD - your missions section. The screen turns to black, and after around 2 seconds you are now in the first person inside your spaceship<sup>[4](#4)</sup>* <br/>

*Another speech bubble pops up; this time it's Starrix Lierge (the Miydlian-Midgard Fleet Commander). He is a tall, blue-skinned alien with a dramatic persona. He's in the form of a hologram.* <br/>

<center> STARRIX LIERGE[<sup>[5](#5)</sup> </center>
<center> "Hi, my name's Starrix; I'm the Midgard Fleet Commander. I expect that Opus has told you about what we need to do?" </center> <br/>

<center> YOUR CHARACTER[<sup>[6](#6)</sup> </center>
<center> Choices available to your character:</center><br/>
1. Yes
2. No
3. Absolutely, I'm ready 

* [If answer is `"1"`](#if-1-or-3)
* [If answer is `"2"`](#if-2)
* [If answer is `"3"`](#if-1-or-3)

To find out more about your choices, go to [Footnote 6<sup>6</sup>](#6) <br/>

#### If 1 or 3
<center> STARRIX LIERGE </center>
<center> "That's good, soldier. Opus<sup>[7](#7)</sup> did better than he usually does" *laughs* "Just kidding - if you have Opus, you'll be right."</center><br/>

*Starrix starts to pace around, and he strokes his goatee.* <br/>

<center> STARRIX LIERGE </center>
<center> "Now, this is something that we never imagined. We've known for a long time that ancient civilizations - " *looks at datapad* "perhaps the forerunners of the Miydlians or the Cancrinites - had incredible technology that we can't imagine today. But we didn't know that this technology still existed."</center>

*Starrix is obviously excited. The hologram flickers slightly as Opus comes into view.* <br/>

<center> OPUS </center>
<center> "That's enough chit-chat for now, Starrix. We've got a war to win." *Opus turns to face you* "Go, Soldier" </center>



#### If 2
<center> STARRIX LIERGE </center>
<center> "Well, we don't have much time, but he really should have told you...in fact, it's very weird that he hasn't".....</center><br/>

*Starrix looks down at his datapad (still in hologram form) and sends a message to Opus. The message flickers up on your console screen in your starship for a second before flashing away again. A loud beep is heard, and Starrix looks up, with shock and angst on his face. He then composes himself - his men should never see him lose his composure - and turns to face you again* <br/>

<center> STARRIX LIERGE </center>
<center> "Oh blimey, I've gotta go. Just fly around and collect those spinning box things." </center> <br/>

*Starrix's hologram disappears as the screen fades to black slightly before your ship is jetisoned >>* <br/>


## Scene 2
(Act 1, Scene 2 - Opening Act) <br/>

*You're now quickly jetisoned from the station and you see the stars around you. Dozens of ships similar to yours are flying around, ducking and weaving through the clouds of gas and zooming back to the station. You spot a red cube floating and spinning around, and a speech bubble pops up* <br/>

<center> CONSOLE CPU </center>
<center> "Let's get started by flying over that red box over there." </center> <br/>

*Out in space, near a planet<sup>[8](#8)</sup>, a red box is located. The minimap in the top-right-hand-corner shows a red icon that's flashing from dark red to light red - this is how we know it's an artifact." <br/>* 

*Another speech bubble appears, this time it's the ship's console CPU (sort of like the tutorial). The speech bubble is different for the tutorial sections*<br/>

<center> CONSOLE CPU Tut<sup>[9](#9)</sup> </center>
<center> "Let's run through the controls quickly, shall we?" <br/> <br/> "The traditional controls that you probably learnt in the academy, W,A,S,D apply here. The map of your location is shown at the top right-hand corner of the display, however it is also available on your ship's display." <br/><br/> "The flashing icons show special artifacts or mission objectives, while the circles show heavenly bodies like planets and comets, green icons show friendly ships and red icons show enemy ships." <br/>  </center>

<!-- sup links - * - [<sup>3</sup>](#3) -->

<center> Player Action </center>
<center> User presses W to move forward, with the red box directly in front of the player. A small window in the top right of the screen appears:</center>

*"You've unlocked <!--think of sci-fi word that can go here to replace/add to unlocked--> an achievement: 'Natural Pilot'."*<!-- The user earns some **ship energy**, **5 credits**, and some **acord points** (these can be redeemed by entering a code (check out MyCred - http://acord.software/stellarios/hydejack/open-source/network/2020-03-25-opensourcesocialnetworks/).

Add an icon for the achivement, along with the player's avatar-->

<center> Player Action </center>
<center> The player rides around the game environment like in </center> [Asteroid Dodgers](https://github.com/acord-robotics/unityballs), <center> collecting the artifacts (as a new achievement pops up - Galactic Archivist/Archaelogist). They're put into the cargo hold of the ship, which flashes up as a new tab in the inventory of the player, where the player can then research the artifacts that he's found. </center>

# Scene 3
Starrix
The ship flies in as you gently pull your helmet off. Starrix comes up to you and says:
"Nice flying soldier...""
  
  
# Discussion

{% include utterances.html %}

{% include jointcomments.html %}

<!-- is there somehow a way that we can incorporate this project into something like Seti@Home?

I've shared discussions and ideas on the r/ACORDRobotics subreddit (reddit.com/r/ACORDRobotics) to do with the pis and stuff. If there was a way to incorporate the two... maybe something like this https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/2eqybl/new_easter_egg_discovered_disk_13_not_to_be/ that could be created from the "rss feed"-like thing of the activity in the game. This could create help new maps that the rl-agent could test, like in Github/Acord-Robotics/AWS_JPL_OSR_DRL (the "Acord-Robotics" could be replaced with "Exynos-999"-->

# Footnotes
###### 1
1. Command table - like in Star Wars: ROTJ (1983) 
###### 2
2. CONSULE CPU - little speech bubble with the avatar of the character on the edge 
###### 3
3. Pushing flight suits on, etc - like the scenes in SW before a naval (spaceship) fight/battle 
###### 4
4. Inside your spaceship - currently this is the [Acord-Robotics/`Asteroid-Dodgers`](http://github.com/acord-robotics/unityballs) scene, which only shows the external ship view. For now (25.02.2020) we will just ignore this for the sake of the story 
###### 5
5. Starrix Lierge - We'll have links (like in [CSS Solar System](http://codepen.io/irisdroidology) to the character/lore bio...
###### 6
6. YOUR CHARACTER - whenever "YOUR CHARACTER" is seen on the script, it shows that you have a selection of choices (i.e. inputs). Sometimes these are multiple choice, sometimes they are just straight character input
###### 7
7. Whenever a speechbubble/other entity/thing mentions an entity, a link appears
###### 8
8. Like in Eve Online, when you're warping (not through a gate) 
![](https://cdn1us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/2019/05/eve-online-amarr-fleet.png)
We could potentially use similar art - photoshop? - to create backgrounds. Remember that Manacaster - for now - is a 2D Unity game, but this part could potentially have 3D elements?
###### 9
9. Refers to tutorial sections - Tut.

Creating the game art is the second step after creating the plot for the game.

# Star Sailors - the novel
* The opening chapters take the place of Chapter 8, and we'll add cutscenes and mini-games for each of the previous chapters. These unlock rewards, cosmetics, etc.

# How it works
* Users sign up on the Star Sailors dashboard (<AC0/RD> website)
* They get a code depending on what species they are, and their name
* They input the code into Manacaster

* This behaviour is the same for different parts of the game

# To-Do
* Add links to footnotes ([.](.))
* Finish your choices (<sup>6</sup>)
