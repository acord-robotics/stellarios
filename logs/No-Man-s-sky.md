Go to  http://acord-robotics.github.io/stellarios/ACORD to see the other games  that are part of the Stellarios network, or the repo at  http://github.com/acord-robotics/stellarios

I've finished one  of the science missions for the resident scientist at the base (cobalt  and marrow roots), updated the base, etc.

The base is currently made out of wood (carbon), however this will change as we get more stuff.

The layout will also slightly change.

Enjoy!
