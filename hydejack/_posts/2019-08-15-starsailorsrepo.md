  We've used the Star Sailors Repo (Github/Acord-Robotics/StarSailors) for the past few months to catalogue the development of Stellarios. From now, that repo will only dicuss the development of the Star Sailors novella series, which will also be discussed here.

Over 1000 commitments have been made to the Star Sailors repo, however ACORD have decided that the Stellarios repo is more appropriate for what the Star Sailors repo was being used for.

The Star Sailors repository will still be used for the writing, development and "publication" of the Star Sailors novella. The Stellarios (gh-pages branch) repository will also host the novella.

# Star Sailors

Star Sailors is a novella based loosely off of the Star Wars series of science-fiction movies, comics and novels. 

The prologue and Chapters 1-8 are available on the [Star Sailors repo](http://acord-robotics.github.io/starsailors) as well as on [this repo](http://acord-robotics.github.io/stellarios/compass). The Star Sailors repo blog will be archived - that is, no new posts will be published on it unless they are to do with Star Sailors, for example:

* Chapter 4 completed

ACORD members can read the exclusive 9th chapter on the [ACORD Portal](http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/starsailors). 

There is an RPG being developed based off of Star Sailors, as well as a series of games that can be played to "level up" or move ahead in the RPG, which is currently in development and is available on the Portal.
