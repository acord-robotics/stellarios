description: On the Stellarios repository, we have a branch called "Arduino" which is for all our Arduino & Raspberry Pi project (for example the Open Source Rover). We have created another repository to house the documentation. This is located at [Github/Acord-Robotics/Arduino-Stellarios](http://github.com/acord-robotics/arduino-stellarios). The documentation is also located in the Arduino branch, however we created this site for easier documentation.
