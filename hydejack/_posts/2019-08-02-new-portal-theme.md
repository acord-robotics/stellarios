description: ACORD has decided to move on from the Aardvark theme by Ghostpool, which we've used since March this year. We've moved to the Olympus theme, which is a very modern-looking template for Buddypress sites. Buddyboss (2016-17) >> Buddyapp (2017) >> Thrive (2018-19) >> Aardvark (2019) >> Olympus + Youzer (2019)

I was looking around for some good buddypress themes just out of interest on Wednesday or Thursday, and I came across a theme called "Olympus". Now, I had no real intentions of changing the theme of the ACORD website from Aardvark - it had, after all, served me pretty well. The only real problem I had with Aardvark was the header menu, but that could easily be fixed, and the other members of ACORD had no problem with it.

However, that all changed when I came across the Olympus theme.

This theme uses a plugin called [Youzer](http://youzer.kainelabs.com). The cool thing about this plugin is that it gives a complete overhaul of the traditional buddypress structure and layout, and adds a number of really awesome things as well:

* New buddypress tab - overview. This is where users can set widgets for their profile, for example portfolio or about me
* 14 different header styles
* Completely customizable navigation
* Much more - check out [their website](http://youzer.kainelabs.com) to see more

I'd tangled with Youzer in the past when I was using the Thrive theme by Dunhakdis, however it had become a bit of an eyesore with Thrive contrasting strongly with it. I'd contemplated going back to it with Aardvark, however the Aardvark theme was fine without it.

But a theme built *for* Youzer? That was something that I'd never seen before, and *definitely* something worth looking into. 

The theme doesn't have many customization options available via the wordpress customizer, however there isn't really much need for the level of customization seen in the other themes I've used. The site looks perfect and definitely has a much more minimal look than the previous theme.
