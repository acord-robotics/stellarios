# Machine Learning - Elite Data Science

Link: https://elitedatascience.com/learn-machine-learning



## What is machine learning?

* The purpose of machine learning is to teach computers how to learn from data to make decisions, or predictions
* True machine learning occurs when the computer learns to identify patterns without being programmed to

Machine learning is often referred to/labelled as many other things:

* Data Science
* Big Data
* Artificial Intelligence (AI)
* Computation Statistics
* Data Mining
* Predictive Analysis

However, while machine learning does overlap with these fields, it is one tool for data science. It is also one use of infrastructure that can handle big data

### Types/Examples of machine learning

#### Supervised Learning

Your email provider (i.e. gmail) automatically places "dodgy" emails in your spam folder (however, this is not always perfect. Machine learning is designed to learn as you use the software, so the more messages you send to/remove from the spam folder, the better it will (theoretically) be)

#### Unsupervised Learning

Marketing & advertising companies use behavior and demographic indicators to segment/separate their customers into targeted groups. This allows them to market different offers/products to different people. Because some people may like iPads and some may prefer Sony tablets, it is cheaper to determine who likes who and create smaller advertising campaigns for each group, rather than creating multiple campaigns for everyone.

#### Reinforcement Learning

A computer and camera that are part of a self-driving car interact with the road. Other cars can learn how to navigate a city based on this



## Why learn machine learning?

* Massive global demand
* Data is power
* Fun & mentally demanding
