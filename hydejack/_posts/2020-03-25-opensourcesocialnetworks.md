# Open Source Social Networks - a viable option?

Facebook. Twitter. Instagram. Google+ (just kidding). They're all websites that are used by hundreds of millions of people every day, and they all have one thing in common.

They're social networking sites.

Before we go any further into this post, if you haven't already read [our post on what a social network is, and how to create one](https://blog.acord.software/post/611414544827432960/constructing-a-social-network), I'd recommend checking that out as well.

# Social Network Websites & Online Communities

> A social networking service is an online platform which people use to build social networks or social relationship with other people who share similar personal or career interests, activities, backgrounds or real-life connections. Social networking services vary in format and the number of features.

Social Networks according to Wikipedia, an open-source online community

We've already looked at a few incredibly popular social networking websites, like Facebook, but here's a few more that we're going to analyze in detail about what makes them successful.

* [The Wordpress.org Community](https://wordpress.org) --> Wordpress, the popular CMS that powers over 25% of the world's websites, has a successful community powered by the robust BBPress forum plug-in
* [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com] --> The popular blogging system that was bought out by Yahoo is a social networking website
* [Youtube](https://youtu.be) --> While it's 99% a video-sharing platform, it's still a social network
* [Reddit](https://reddit.com) --> Perhaps the epitomy of social networking websites. Really puts the `community` into social network

`With over 3.2 BILLION users on social media worldwide, it's one of the best-selling product genres`

With the exception of Reddit, and perhaps the Wordpress website, I'd argue that none of the websites mentioned above are "community websites". Sure, they all have social networking features, but do the fit with the criteria that makes them a community website as well? Well, yes - according to Wikipedia:

> An online community, also called an internet community or web community, is a virtual community whose members interact with each other primarily via the Internet. For many, online communities may feel like home, consisting of a "family of invisible friends".

But there are different definitions when it comes to this subject. Here's a definition for community building from `social media today`:

> Community building is a process of building a following of people with a common interest around a product/brand, personal brand, blog, or site online. (outline of how this is accomplished online - utilizing social media tools, providing a platform, contesting, online chats, webinars, providing resources, etc)

There's plenty more that you can easily find by doing a search on google:

But here's a definition that, as both a user and a creator of social networks & community websites, I find valid:

> A social networking website is an online service that individiuals use to form connections with other users through the sharing of content (like photos, text posts, and videos) and to discover new communities related to their interests. Social networking websites are also used to promote a brand to a wide community, while community websites are mainly for already-established groups regarding a main, overarching topic, whether that's a movie series or a brand like Apple, or anything in between.

That's a bit of a long definition, and I understand that that's going to cause some controversy. So I'd like to whack a big "Disclaimer" before I go any further:

## Disclaimer
You are free to call Facebook an online community, and to an extent it is - billions of people sharing content and making connections with anyway. But services like Facebook, Instagram, `the whole of Reddit`, and many other large websites, are successful because they cater to everyone, not to a specific clique of individuals or users. Imagine if Facebook was only for Star Wars fans to discuss Star Wars-related topics. Suddenly the number of users would plummet into the millions. Similarly, if the Star Wars website was expanded to cater to everyone and every topic, you'd see many more people joining (the number of users does depend, of course, on the quality of your content and the amount of traffic your site gets). 

# Humhub
