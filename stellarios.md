# Robots and Software

At ACORD, we intend to create robots and software for every purpose. Want a rover to explore Mars? We'll make it. Need a game made? We'll code it. ACORD is a not-for-profit organisation that seeks to design, develop and package creations that will go out and do good in the world.

Stellarios is part of that good that we will do. With Stellarios, you can control any product made by ACORD. It comes with some cool games as well! Everything on Stellarios can be run on mobile, PC, and Mac/Linux.

## Robots

Our robots serve a variety of purposes. Our main project at this time, A0-D2, is being created for a variety of reasons - 

* [Testing & Developing Stellarios](/stellarios/testing) - The physical robot will be connected to a "virtual robot" inside Stellarios, meaning you can take your robot anywhere
* [Science Experiments](/stellarios/science) - Learn about our science work here
* [Companion for people with disabilities](/stellarios/companion) - Learn about our "companion robots" here

* [A0-D2 Build Log](/stellarios/a0d2-log)

## Games in Stellarios

### Made by us

* [Asteroid Dodgers](http://github.com/acord-robotics/unityballs) - Our first game, in Asteroid Dodgers you fly a ship around collecting artifacts and - you guessed it - dodging asteroids

### Other games

Some games that we think are worthy of being in Stellarios are included. These games have personally bought us great happiness playing them and they are truly innovative. You can view these games at this [repo](http://github.com/acord-robotics/stellarios/blob/master/README.md) and if you want to add games to it, fork [this repo](http://github.com/acord-robotics/stellarios-sugestions) to tell us about them! Also go here: allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/2019/11/01/the-stellarios-family-whos-a-part-of-it/



# Stellarios Map

This will be kind of how Stellarios will be laid out. We have a [scratch project](scratch.mit.edu/projects/323541078) which shows how the applications will look.



## Robots

* Control robots (both physical and virtual)
* Build instructions (like Littlebits, you will be able to customize the robot)
* Play (send on adventures, control, play Stellarios games with them) 
* Talk
* Code 
* Customize (virtual robot)
* Zooniverse

## Games

* Games by yourself

### Games by us

* Asteroid Dodgers

### Games by "Them"

* Backflip Studios
* Astronest
* Hello Games/No Man's Sky
* Merge Dragons
* Eve Online
* Minecraft
* Starbound
* Terragenesis
* Replika

## Media

### CS
I'm currently doing a computer science course at school, and I'm aiming to get into a Software Engineering course at university. To code Star Sailors, I'll be needing to learn the following coding languages:

* HTML
* CSS
* Python
* PHP
* Java & Javascript
* C, C#, C++

I'll be starting with Python for 2 reasons:

* I know how to code basic things in Python (and it is needed)
* In August we'll be doing Python in school

Because of this, I'll be learning all about Python and how to use it. There are 2 repos that I will be sharing my knowledge, notes and basic code:

[DroidOS Python Repo](http://irisdroidology.github.io/droidos-python)
[Star Sailors Repo](http://acord-robotics.github.io/starsailors/droidos-python/)

I'll be storing it here as well as on my personal Github account.

ACORD Robotics, founded in December 2015, is currently creating robots, games, software and hardware for scientists and the public. One of these games is Star Sailors, based on the novella series of the same name, written by the ACORD chairman @IrisDroidology.

Star Sailors is an online-RPG which will be bundled together with StellariOS in the ACORD app.

# Stellarios
Stellarios is a suite of applications that is made by ACORD. Coded in a variety of languages, these apps are games, robotic controllers, and much more.

## Acord app
* Laid out like *Terragenesis* App

## Games
### Unityballs
Github/irisdroidology/unityballs
### Terragenesis

Terragenesis, developed by Edgeworks entertainment, is a space colonization game available for AnDroidOS and iDroidOS. In Terragenesis you pick a planet (for example Mars), and research technology that is used to make your planet more liveable, for example oxygen generators.

The application is really nicely designed and will provide an inspiration for our application. For example, the menu system of Terragenesis will be copied into the DroidOS app. Once you’ve opened a planet in Terragenesis, you see the current state of the planet (for example, a green, lush globe), and this will also be used in the app. See the droid controller section for more.
Droid Controllers

#### TG Stats
* Mercury: 100% (beginner, daughters of gaia)
* Venus: 100% (beginner, united nations)
* Earth: 20% (normal, biosphere, horizon corporation)
* Mars: 100% (beginner, daughters of gaia)
* Moon: 100% (normal, biosphere, united nations)

Once youve opened the droid control part of the app, you’ll be able to select which model of Droid you want to control (including virtual droids.). Once you’ve selected your model, the droid will be slowly spinning around, with different parts of the droid corresponding to different functions (touching the feet will select the movement function, for example).

### Backflip Studio Games
Backflip studios have made a number of awesome games that I've played, including Dragonvale (World) and Gizmonauts (a space & robotics colony game). Backflip studio games emphasise collection of different objects (like dragons) of different types, and the housing of these objects in different habitats. Some stellarios games will follow this model as well, with robots &  aliens being collected, sorted, bred, etc.

### Portal Pages
#### Stellarios
Stellarios is available for ACORD members on the portal. Every single application that has been created is on its own page:
* [Stellarios Portal](http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/stellarios)
* [Star Sailors Game](http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/stellarios/star-sailors)
* [Minigames](http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/stellarios/minigames)

### Themes
Currently we are using the Aardvark theme by Ghostpool, however there are many other cool themes like Buddyboss and Thrive (which we used last year.) We are always on the lookout for cool new themes, however right now Aardvark does the job well.

### Resources
You can find out how the portal works here: http://acord.tech/portal-help

### Gitlab
We're going to be using Gitlab as a secondary git client. Gitlab and Github will be filled up with more projects and people once we've got more active members (however we will be attempting to get 1 contribution each day on each git client).

* [Gitlab Group](http://gitlab.com/acord-robotics)
* [Gitlab Profile](http://gitlab.com/irisdroidology)

* [Gitlab Repo](http://gitlab.com/acord-robotics/robodev/s2rd)

The github repository will be made private once we upgrade to a more expensive Github plan. Then both the gitlab and github clients will be private

# Maintenance
This repo has been moved to acord.tech/gitlab/acord-robotics/robodev/stellarios
Any changes on github will be reflected in gitlab. Bitbucket? This is to ensure that online cloud-based IDE code editors can be used. Gitpod is currently our editor of choice

This repo on acord.tech/github will be used for jekyll only, however it will still be updated from gitlab.
Backing up: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/backup_restore.html#rsync, https://gitlab.com/acord-robotics/robodev/star-sailors/issues/9

## ACORD Members Stuff
* Chairman's stuff: http://acord.tech/opus
The theme we're thinking of using is https://github.com/artemsheludko/adam-blog. This could also be used for the Star Sailors blog - this repo is now for the book navigation.  We forked that repo: http://github.com/irisdroidology/otr
