"Can you send him into my office?" The chancellor spoke into his comlink with a big smile on his face. Finally, he'd get the chance to speak to an alien. And not just someone from a different species. No, this was someone - or rather something - that was completely alien in the true sense of the word, both to his culture and to his galaxy. "That's great, he's here now?  Send him in, please."  He paused for a moment. "Yes, I want you to put them into the barracks, train them up, explain what's going on. Provide them a video link to this room, I'll speak with them as well. We're not barbarians." 

The door slid open and a metallic sound played. In walked Starrix Lierge, Miydlian Fleet Commander, and the human - whooman? Hyman? - the alien. The alien sat down in a chair before he was directed to sit down, but Jayin let it go. This was all new to him. Did these aliens have chairs where they come from - how else would he have known to sit down? All these questions buzzed around in his brains like a hive of bees, and while this was often one of his greatest strengths, right now he needed his full attention on the alien. He turned on a translator application on his comlink and began to talk.

------------------

Gilbert was led into the wide room by the tall, blue alien that had drugged him earlier. His body responded to his commands completely and he seemed to be free of the drug, but there was no way to know for sure until he tried something. He blinked a few times as his eyes were watering continuously - it was an incredibly bright environment that he was in, and although he didn't know it yet, Jayin's species needed bright lights to function. "Is this some kind of torture device?" he asked himself. He had been told by another alien, one who introduced himself as Tullo, that he'd been rescued from a terrible fate and that the Chancellor of the Galactic Parliament was most eager to meet him. "What a bad joke...chancellor of the galactic parliament...sure." He had not believed Tullo for one second, and as soon as he left his ship he decided that he was in the camp of the enemy.

When Gilbert had been young, before he'd left Earth, he'd been dazzled by displays of bright fireworks. When he was 5, he'd envisioned setting off fireworks at barbecues or parties as his job...until someone, his sister, had set off a small one in front of his face, which had blinded him for 2 years until his parents could receive the money to afford his treatment. He'd never forgotten that dark, dark cave that had no escape, and he'd never forgotten that split second where his eyes were exposed to light brighter than the sun. To this day, he was still terrified of bright lights.

So when he was led into the homely offices of the Chancellor, he was surprised. The lights suddenly dimmed and he was gently pushed into a chair. The being in front of him was a tall, bipedal alien that commanded the room with such authority so that Gilbert knew immediately that he was the Chancellor. There were no holo-images of his family members (Gilbert knew that holo-images were universal, during the Scavenger Fleet's brief stay with the aliens of Proxima Centauri, the indigenous oceanic beings had developed a similar device to the ones that humans used), there weren't many documents around the room either. Apparently these aliens liked it plain. He'd just sat down when Jayin began to speak. The guard left the room.

"Can you - can he understand me?" Jayin said in a distorted voice. He seemed to be saying this both to Gilbert as well as to someone beside him - no, he was speaking into a microphone. Gilbert blinked sweat and tears out of his eyes and decided he needed to focus. Regardless of if these were the bad guys, there were bad guys that were out to get him. He would cooperate initially, and he was coming to this thought when he heard a watery, bubbly splashing sound come through his ears as the sound became clearer. "Can you - can he understand me?" 

"They must be replaying the same message now that it's not as distorted" Gilbert thought as he worked up the courage to say something. "Do you sp-speak English?" "This could be the first time a human has communicated with someone from a multi-planetary-based community". The chancellor looked confused as he thought about how to reply. 

"Is English their language?" he asked someone into his microphone and this time, Gilbert didn't hear it. The sound issues must have been fixed because he no longer felt a sort of blockage in his ear. Jayin had apparently received an affirmative because he then said to Gilbert, "We do not speak your language, we're using a translating function to allow you to understand us. There is a small wire attached from the base of your brain to the edge of what you call the eardrum. But there is much to talk about, so please stand up and come with me." Jayin got out of his chair and motioned for Gilbert to do the same. "I think you will enjoy your stay here in the galactic capital."

Now for Gilbert, who had no home to return to (as far as he knew), he knew - he just knew it - that his stay would be the most unenjoyable that it could possibly be. No home, no sign of the rest of the Scavenger Fleet...when suddenly he walked right into Alek Vichava. "Alek?" he asked in shock and amazement. He hadn't seen him since he'd received that message in the Scavengers' ship, which now seemed like a lifetime ago. But the imagery and sensory information his body was receiving was too vivid for it to be not real.

"Gilbert!" Alek came racing over to Gilbert and enveloped him in a bear hug. They'd never been the best of friends - in fact, Gilbert could probably count on 2 hands the number of conversations they'd had - but Gilbert knew what it was like to see a familiar face in such an unfamiliar place. Releasing Gilbert, he said "You know Tello? He's got a cool starship model to show you. We're rescuing Opus."

-----

Opus's eyes flickered open. He felt blisters all over his body, and although his eyes were open, he couldn't see anything. He felt something wet and slimy slither over his right arm. His left arm was trapped underneath some sort of rubble. 

"No need to worry. What's the situation. Think it through. Breathe," he told himself, and gradually he moved his right arm around and felt a console dashboard, the kind of one that might be found, in a better time, on a door on a Scavenger spacecraft. If he was lying on the floor, this dashboard must also be on the floor, so you might assume it would not work. Opus's hand reached around the dashboard and pressed a button. He couldn't see it, but he knew that it was yellow and black.

As soon as he pressed this button, a message was sent to his second in command, to a comlink hidden in a place that no-one would think to look. He held down the button long enough for his fingerprint to register and for his brainwaves to be picked up by the transmitter, and then he took his finger off. He placed his finger back on the button, and he felt a shock of electricity that signaled that the message had been passed on and had been received. There was no doubt about it.

"Now to find out what's around me and where I am."

---

Gilbert, Alek & Jayin walked briskly down a hallway. The walls pulsed with some sort of energy; bright lights flowed. The texture of the walls was unusual also. It was all very alien to Gilbert & Alek, but to Jayin it was home. He led them down through the hallway towards a set of double doors. The doors opened as soon as Jayin stood in front of them, but there was no motion sensor above the door. "Maybe it's thought-activated," thought Gilbert as he followed the Chancellor through the doors, and he stopped so suddenly that Alek almost walked into him. There were bodies inside the room. Human bodies. And they were alive.

Gilbert rushed to one of them. He could see them breathing, but none of them were awake. He bent down to feel for a pulse when he heard a voice behind him. "We've rendered them unconscious for simplicity. When you need them, they'll wake." 

Gilbert spun around and saw Jayin standing behind him with an expression of - it was hard to tell with this alien face - understanding? Concern? Whatever it was, Jayin's head looked disembodied thanks to the lighting around him, which was moving in time with some silent beat so that the room was flooded with the same sort of light that a disco ball might create.

"Come this way, Gilbert," Alek said. He'd given him a moment, but they needed to move on. Unlike Gilbert, he knew roughly what was going on. It wasn't good.

----

Opus heard the doors slam open loudly. He looked up, with his eyes opened. While they were still watering, his vision was good enough to see that there was nothing in front of him. Then he remembered where he was. On a small spaceship, with a cockpit and a galley. No doors. Could he have possibly imagined that sound?

"He sssssent a message! He mussst be killed!" 

A hissing voice, one that Opus somehow understood, spoke these words in a threatening voice. Opus heard footsteps coming towards him, and a small oil light flickered on, illuminating their shadows. Opus was pretty sure he couldn't be seen, but he knew now that he wasn't hallucinating. Those shadows were real. They were long, with an unusual shape that no human shadow would have. And there was more than just one of them.

"Quietsssss! He can understand usssss."

This voice was more measured and calm, but Opus guessed that this was the true source of authority here. "Well, I've just lost my advantage now.  And they must know that I'm here!" His arm was still trapped underneath the rubble, but now that he thought about it he figured he may be able to get out from under it and run. But where to run to?

He was so deep in thought that he barely heard the second being speak. "Go and fetch him. Now. We needs him."

His mind already made up, he ran his right hand across his body until he reached the rubble that was covering his arm. He was about to pull it off when a slightly slimy hand backhanded him across the face.

----

"So, gentlemen. Please take a seat."

They were back in Jayin's office. A tank filled with a clear liquid and a small, amphibious creature that Gilbert hadn't noticed before was on Jayin's desk. It swam around in a hypnotic manner, and Gilbert's eyes were drawn to it. The lights and panels in the office swam with bright flashes of luminescence but by now Gilbert - and his eyes - were used to it. Jayin made a sound somewhat like a human would make clearing his throat, and Gilbert dragged his eyes away from the animal and towards the Chancellor. 

"Do you know what happened to our Earth?" Gilbert asked. He had no time to waste - Opus's life was in danger. Every minute that they spent in this office was another minute that he was away from his Captain, and all true Scavengers were 100% loyal to their captain. No doubt about it. 

"If by Earth, you mean your planet, then yes. We have an idea of what happened to it. However, we - that is you and me - have a problem.  The Parliament doesn't want anything to do with your cause, which is considered to be extremely dangerous." Jayin pressed a button on his desk, and the blue-skinned alien that had drugged Gilbert walked in through a concealed door. Gilbert backed away in his chair. "This is Starrix, he's the fleet commander. He rescued you and while you were fighting those pirates he saw that you had a unique formation, a different flight pattern to the one that our pilots fly with. You shot down over 40 fighters! And there's nothing to fear," he added, as he saw Gilbert moving away, "if you trust me, you can trust him."

Gilbert opened his mouth as if he was about to speak, but Starrix - the other alien - stopped him. "Do not speak! Listen. Look, the Parliament has said it's too dangerous to rescue your....Captain. They believe they know what - who - took him. But we've come up against this group before. They're very fast, very dangerous. The aliens from the worlds you call "Kepler" have lost planets - entire systems - as well."

Johannes Kepler was a brilliant mathematician & astronomer who was a key figure in the scientific revolution during the 17th century. In the 21st century, NASA launched a space telescope called Kepler to search for potentially habitable exoplanets via the "transit method". This method detects distant planets by measuring the minute dimming of a star as an orbiting planet passes between it and the Earth. The passage of a planet between a star and the Earth is called a "transit".

"Why are these Kepler worlds being singled out? I thought that any planet could be discovered via the transit method?" Gilbert asked. 

Jayin rubbed his hand across his skull. "You see, while any planet could be discovered with the transit method, the Kepler mission was flawed from the outset (which was one of the reasons behind the K2 part of the mission). Because of this, only planets that had a specific concentration of some trace elements and compounds in the atmosphere could be discovered. These planets were home to the Keplernians, who are the only intelligent species we know that can survive unaided on the surface of those planets". 

"But why would these planets be taken?" Alek spoke up for the first time. "And who has taken them?" He'd teach these aliens a thing or two. 

"Unfortunately, we don't know why they were destroyed. But there's no true appeal to any species apart from those that can survive on those worlds. In fact, you are, what you might call, Keplernians. You could survive on those planets, irrespective of the gravity or atmospheric pressure."

"However, we do know who - or at least, we think we know - who's taken them. I'm not authorized to say anything else for now, so I think I should let Starrix take you to the Parliament. You'll be joining the Keplernian branch."

------

Opus led Alek towards the pod that held the Keplernians. The Keplernians looked quite like the "Grays" that were in popular culture movies on Earth in the 20th century. 

"We are glad to have you at our pod. We hope you learn a lot with us. We'll do our best to integrate you into the fold, and if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask." The grey Keplernian, who was more of a faded blue-grey colour than grey, stuck out his hand in a gesture of - a handshake? "Some things never change," Gilbert thought as he shook the hand of the Keplernian.

"I'm Gilbert," he began. This place was massive! Forget the senate from Star Wars, this parliament was amazing! Apart from the fact that it was situated on a small asteroid orbiting Midgard, the galactic capital, the glass flooring and walls meant that you could see all around space. It was as if he was on a cruise ship. Midgard was truly situated in the middle of some interesting territory - literally the centre of the galaxy, a quasar was shooting out energy foam only 12 light years away. It made for a stunning view, but Gilbert knew that no-one could live where they were if there wasn't any serious protection technology around the galactic core. How long had it taken to terraform this area to be the galactic capital?

"We know. We - and you - are Keplernians. We understand your language, and you understand ours. Your mannerisms betray your thoughts to us. We know what you're thinking on this pod. Once, all Keplernians had this ability. But our minds frayed and we became weaker individually, but stronger together, through the power of cooperation that has empowered our races to the top of the respective food chains on each of our worlds. We, along with the Miydlians, developed this pod to temporarily allow us to regain this power, allowing us to make fast, informed and efficient decisions regardless of where we are in the universe. This asteroid is situated above a spire of power from Midgard, which possibly leads to another dimension - the Stellaris region."

Most of us Keplernians don't speak for this long upon meeting someone for the first time, but Gilbert and his team needed to be caught up on galactic/universal politics fast. The Parliament was opening - any minute now!

-----

Jayin stood up from his desk and pressed a button hidden under the desk. A hole in the floor opened, and a staircase appeared. The staircase led down to a basement full of more pulsing lights and devices. Dust ran across the top of these devices like paint. Jayin selected one and took it off the shelf that it was in. A little fly-like rover, about 3 inches across. "Go now, go to the Keplernians." he said in the ancient language of the Miydlians. "Get them onto the Scroobs." And he shuffled away to the car that would take him to the Chancellor's Pod as the rover flew up out of the stairs and towards the senate.




# Chapter 6 - Backroom Sports
"Citizens of the universe, welcome back to the Senate. Can everyone please stay in their assigned pods for the duration of this meeting."

Jayin's voice boomed out from the center of a small chamber. There were little honeycombs around this chamber, with small models of pods situated around the area, creating an illusion that everyone was there. Everyone was situated on differing asteroids, with this being both a security measure and a way to ensure maximum efficiency for all the Senators and their aides (and occasionally the governors of the planets, who were the ones who nominated their Senators). What had been discovered was that when there were millions of people in one room, with thousands of Senators, things tended to get a bit messy and chaotic. To solve this, everyone was in their own room on their own Asteroid, which was artificial spaceships designed to look like asteroids; they could be piloted up and down to the surface of Midgard. "It makes sense now," Gilbert thought. "I don't understand why we didn't have this system back on Earth." He had also been wondering about the stability of such a set-up, with many thousands of asteroids in orbit around a planet so close to a large moon (about 10% of the area above Midgard was uncovered by satellites, and another 5% was only covered by research satellites). "So the moon is actually a hollowed-out planet that was nudged into orbit around this planet - Midgard - and that's where the asteroids stay until the Parliament/Senate is in session." He'd heard it be called the Parliament and he'd heard it be called the Senate. Regardless, he was here now.

He looked to his right and saw one of the Keplernian Greys next to him. Seeing that he wanted to say something, he unplugged the earpiece he'd been using to listen to the audio feed that Jayin had given him, which was describing the political system. 

"My friend, we're glad to have you with usss." The grey spoke with a lisp and strongly exaggerated his "s" sounds. "There are many Keplernians, with each species in the Keplernian family being nominated as a Senator from their home planet. For example, I've been nominated by the Governor of Kepler-22 and ticked off by Jayin." His eyes fluttered when he said this, and he looked around the Honeycomb in what Gilbert assumed was a look of excitement.

"I thought there was one senator for each world, and they each had their own pod?" Gilbert was confused. Wasn't that how it had worked in Star Wars?

"Ah, yes, you've watched too much Star Wars. Plenty of factual inaccuracies, but it did get a lot of things right" The grey did like to demonstrate his mind-reading capability; but at that moment an alien with green head-tails ("lekku") walked past. The grey watched Gilbert's eyes be drawn towards the Green. "That's Kfit. He's from Kepler Glee."

"Is this some kind of SW fantasy?" Gilbert asked himself, not for the first time. How much had George Lucas gotten right? He knew that Opus would love to hear all about this, and Gilbert (once again) promised himself that he'd rescue Opus from the mess that he'd gotten himself into. "So what about the pods?"

"Ah yes," the grey answered, stroking his chin-whiskers thoughtfully. "So each species family, for example, us Keplernians, is related to each other. Every Keplernian is related closely, we have similar genetic code. We have a small amount of DNA which is very close to identical to yours. Deoxyribonucleic acid is found in all life forms, even microbes - your scientists got that one wrong." He chuckled and continued - "but they did get something right. They found RNA, and mRNA, which is what some of us Keplernians, including myself, are 'coded" from. So each species family has a pod. Every planet that houses a species from that family is sent to a pod, so you, and I, and Kfit, were sent to this pod by Jayin and our Planetary Governor. After this, Jayin nominates a "lead" Senator from this family, who will act as a "mini-chancellor" within our pod. This means that there are millions of Senators, and many of these share a hive mind (well, we all do, but to differing effects and efficiency).  This is how our senate works."

A hush fell over the room, and the lights dimmed - it seemed like the eyes were one of the major sensory organs of most intelligent creatures around the universe. "Back home, huge amounts of animals were nocturnal and didn't use their eyes. We couldn't live without them - is this important in the evolution of intelligent life?" Gilbert thought as he pondered this. He'd always been interested in biology and had frequently gone to the library on Earth and read all about Charles Darwin & Richard Dawkins before they left their planet. 

Kfit, the alien with the head tentacles, or head-tails, spoke up. "Can us Keplernians please welcome Grekzil, the Keplernian Senator, to the pod." Gilbert looked around and saw the blue-skinned alien, Starrix, but there was no-one else that he saw. Starrix waved to him, and Gilbert wondered where Grekzil - and who Grekzil - was. He pulled out the datapad that had been given to him by Jayin - the one that had been reading him the audio feed - and tapped through the database. He found that Grekzil was the Grey he'd been talking to. "Starrix Lierge, Miydlian Fleet Commander, is here for security. Also, please now welcome the aides for each Keplernian senator - Alek Vicheva, please come through."

The doors to their pod hissed open. Before, they were opaque and with a crystal texture. As soon as they started opening, the colour became transparent and you could see who was coming through the opening before the door had fully opened. A tall - like 7 foot tall - man with brown hair came walking through. Of course, this was Alek, but Gilbert had had no idea that he'd have an aide, let alone that it would be Alek. He stood at his console, not knowing what to do as Alek came over to him. They said their hellos and then Gilbert sat back down as the other Senators mingled with their aides. Some of them were with 3 or 4, but Gilbert only had Alek. "That's fine," he thought to himself. He'd always only hung out with one person - Opus - on the ship, and unless he was by himself, he didn't suffer from loneliness. Besides, there was so much interesting stuff to look at to take his mind off his isolation, and the other Keplernians were paying him so much attention, with so much awe, that he just put himself in the moment and thought about his job as Senator. Senator of Earth - who could have imagined that!

The console in the center of the room - the pod - flickered to life, and a hologram of Jayin appeared. The colour started off in the blueish colour like in Star Wars & Star Trek, before fading to become a white design with coloured patches. Jayin's image was so well-focused that the warts and wrinkles were perfectly defined in the image. The holoprojector rotated around the console so that each of the Senators could see the face of their Chancellor.

"Greetings, Senate. May the 136,057th Senate meeting now commence." On-screen, he settled into his chair and pulled out his datapad, and as he did this Gilbert saw an opportunity to ask something to Kfit.

"How long has the Senate been around for?" he asked, curious. He'd always been a student of history and devoured books about topics - both fiction and non-fiction - about this.

"The senate?  Less than 10000 years. But there's been many thousands of iterations around the universe and the galaxy, and each galaxy in the universe is in a state of peace. We're all related to each other - every particle is - through something called the Siri particle - well, that's what your scientists would call it. This binds the universe together, like midichlorians, and is part of the reason why there have been many states of peace in our history. I'd say there has been peace in the galaxy for over a billion years, and colonization - and life - started shortly after the Big Bang, thanks in part to our "midichlorians" that were around at the start of everything."

While he pondered this, Jayin spoke again. "We have picked up a new group of interlopers that have gratefully joined our Senate. These are the citizens from a planet called Earth, which was recently destroyed. This is what we discussed last time. I suggest we call for a vote for mobilization of a navy to track down what happened to Earth, and the other planets like this."

"The real question is, Chancellor, why Earth was taken in the first place. I think that this speaks volumes about the inept commanders that our navy has, the navy that was put into place to keep us safe and to prevent things like this happening!" boomed the senator from Rastreon, Or Freeta, one of the senators who had been there the longest. "There's no point trying to retrieve this planet when more planets can - and will - be taken. We need to focus on prevention! Which world would go next? Kepler? Rastreon? Or even Midgard! The action you're suggesting taking will drag this republic into destruction!" he finished, with applause coming from all corners of the chamber.

"Perhaps the good senator from Rastreon makes a point there," Jayin began, "however we have newcomers to the Senate that have lost their planet. Now is not the time for this discussion."

"If not now, then when, Chancellor?" Xats Avith asked. "You claim that creating a galaxy-wide military is only supported in the Outer Reaches because it would bring wealth and riches to our world. I think you forget that it exploits our worlds as well. We were selected as Senators by you, with you stating that you believed we would put the interests of our people, our worlds and the republic first, before riches and bribes. So if we ask for a military, surely we are not looking our for ourselves and are trying to help! If we are trying to exploit our worlds, then it is you that needs to be removed, because obviously you cannot decide who deserves to be in this Senate Rotunda!"

Chaos reigned. Around Midgard, senators on their asteroids pressed the buttons on their consoles and shouted in their native languages, either supporting or shooting down this demand. Pandemonium reigned, and eventually Jayin just gave up on calling "Order!" and let the chaos reign.

---

They filed out of their asteroid onto a cruiser ship. All of them sat around the edges of the ship, strapped in for the wild ride towards the surface of Midgard. Another console lay in the middle of their area, and right now it was showing a replay of the events that had occured in the Senate that day. 

"Wow," Gilbert thought. "Was I really a part of that?" In that 3-hour session, he'd been introduced and had discussed his homeworld. Many of the Senators swooned with happy memories when he told them about Earth's beautiful landscapes - the most populous planets in the Midgard Republic had very few natural landscapes left - all native life had been moved to small zoos, a kind of cosmic Ark. The sole exception was Midgard, which orbited a triple-star system (Yellow G-Type, a Blue O-Type and a Red M-Type). This gave them a lot of variety, with the flares from the red dwarf and the electromagnetic pulses from the blue supergiant leading to beautiful auroras, some of which looked exactly like the ones on Earth - but they occured all around the planet. The planet was laid out in skyscrapers that went deep into the ground, with flora and fauna almost "taking over" the entire community. It was a paradise.
