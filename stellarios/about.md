# ACORD Robotics
Founded in December 2015, ACORD (formerly known as the Alliance of Droids) is a company that creates robots and software for different uses. Our primary robotic projects are to do with exploration and improving the lives of those with disabilities. We have other, secondary projects. One of these is Star Sailors.

# Star Sailors
Star Sailors exists as a novella and as an online RPG, with hopes to add more games in the future. The series is set in a made-up universe (however, the Earth and our solar system does exist). 

# This website
This website has a number of purposes:
-Post updates about the Star Sailors Universe
-Add code for the game
