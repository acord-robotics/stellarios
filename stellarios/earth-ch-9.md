It’s been a long journey. Sorry for not writing sooner.

Gilbert was made fleet commander last week. He was very proud, and he promised to wear the jacket with pride. We’re sitting together now, on the Curiosity station. I’ll still be a proud protectorate member, but I like some time off and I feel like building the garden.

Speaking of which, the garden is looking great! I’ve finished furnishing Mars (TerraGenesis Photo), and we’ve got some life bumping up there. I’ve been struggling to figure out exactly how I want to organise my garden. I’ll get back to that soon.

Gilbert’s relishing his duty as Leader of the ACORD Protectorate. He still misses me a bit, but we see each other in the garden every now and then. He knows I’ll finish working soon, and we can get back to saving the galaxy. Alex Vicheva always told me that Gilbert was a liability, but I knew that Gilbert wasn’t – and more than that, he was my best friend.

Alex –  well, we all miss Alex. Even when he said things that sounded harsh, we knew that he had the interests of the crew at heart. He was often wrong, but he was selfless, brave, and cunning. The galaxy is a poorer place without him.

The galaxy may be free of all evil, but we’ve got other places to take care of other galaxies as well. That’s next on my bucket list – and I’m pleased to announce the garden is complete!

We’ve got a 10-way binary star system, which is quite confusing but I’ve gotten used to it –

    A pulsar
    Blue Supergiant
    Red Supergiant
    Red Giant
    Yellow dwarf
    Red dwarf
    Orange dwarf
    White dwarf
    Black dwarf/hole
    White giant

All the stars are perfectly balanced, and each star can be access by my portal app on my Stellarios device. We start in the planet around the blue supergiant:

    Blue supergiant: 1 planet
        8 Astronomical Units away
        Life? Yes – microbial
        Experiments: heat-related
    Pulsar: 8 planets
        All planets – 5-9 AU
        Life? Yes
        Experiments: electricity, radiation
    All others (except Yellow & Red dwarf):
        5 planets
        Life? Yes
        Experiments: life
    Red dwarf: 7 planets (Trappist)
        Life? Yes
        Planets: 1,1.3,1.4,1.8,2,8,9 AU
        Life? Yes
        Experiments: life, solar flares, solar radiation

Now we come to my home system, the real garden

    Mars: Intelligent life (6 genus)
        I store my protectorate gear here
        All my Space Ball prizes are here as well
        I conduct research to do with the development of life as well as changing states of matter (water)
    Earth: as it was
        I’ve got Earth as it was before I left. The humans see everything the way it is, but they don’t know what’s going on. One day they will (book 3)
    Every other planet (the way it was, will add more to this)
    Stellarios/Siridium:
        We’ve got a nice colony, sort of laid out like a modern lab in a jungle
        Everything is stored here – droids,
        Opus is actually a Cancrinite, but has every species
        White marble arm (made of siridium) – right arm
        Siridium arm –
            Controls the universe
            Siridium star (pulses different colours, but by default is gold) control panel
            Pressing the button allows Opus to select different modes:
            Universe hopper, Storage, Devices, Experiments, Droid cPanel, Droids, Spaceships, Collections, Communication, Aliens, Weapons)
            Each brings up a holographic display
            Cannot be removed
            Can store things
        Does kill people (after constructing arm), however their essence goes into universe hopper where they can start afresh
        Basically a gauntlet, with a spaceship
        Starbound-themed spaceship/tardis/starfighter
        Means Opus can live forever, universe is never destroyed, arm can’t be removed – everything can go into arm (and i mean everything from the entire multiverse network)
        Finds materials and constructs/develops arm at the end of the first book
        Planetary garden (finds planets in Chapter 7)
        Portal to star wars

It’s been a long journey, and I’m glad to say that Opus Siridium is retired. That chapter has been written. I’ll stay here in this garden forevermore, but my new name is *willchangename Vetrur, after the great warrior and protectorate member. Goodbye Opus, hello Vetrur
