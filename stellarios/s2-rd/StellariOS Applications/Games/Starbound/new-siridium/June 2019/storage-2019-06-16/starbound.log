[18:48:30.535] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> You have found some wood. My databanks tell me wood is a material with a great many uses. I suggest you kill additional trees and explore your crafting menu.
[18:48:41.159] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> I see that you've discovered some seeds. I suggest planting them in some tilled soil, and watering them until they grow. The tools you need can be built at a foraging table.
[18:49:53.222] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> My scans are picking up an unknown radio signal around this archaic energy source. I will patch it through to you now.
[18:49:59.955] [Info] Chat: <???> If you've picked up this message, you must have found an Ancient Gateway - please use it to come and find me. You can power up the Gate with Core Fragments.
[18:50:10.589] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> I have scanned for nearby Core Fragments. They appear naturally within the geology of this planet; readings suggest numerous ore clusters deep below the ground, near the planet's centre.

[18:52:55.157] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> You discovered some plant fibre. This can be woven into useful fabrics at a spinning wheel.
[18:53:44.817] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> You discovered some ore. Ore can be turned into bars using a furnace, bars are useful for crafting a wide range of equipment that may increase your life expectancy.
[18:55:11.578] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> I am detecting a variety of life signs in this mine. If you are intending to search it for core fragments, I may advise adequately arming yourself first.
[18:55:22.144] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> If you are not sufficiently confident in your personal combat capabilities, an alternative solution would be to dig closer to the planet's center to find the core fragments.

[18:55:33.244] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> You discovered a core fragment! These are useful objects. I estimate that you will require at least 20 of them.
[18:55:42.759] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> You've obtained a manipulator module. With enough of these you can upgrade your Matter Manipulator from the access panel on the right-hand toolbar.
[18:59:18.625] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> You acquired Storage Matter. This material can be used to create your own storage objects and more. I suggest you find a proper machine through exploring the universe.

[19:06:09.753] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> All life readings emanate from a great depth below the surface. The readings are... Difficult to define. Congratulations in advance for your courage.
[19:06:20.252] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> It appears lockdown has been instigated. You must locate a breaker to restore full power. Please proceed with caution in conditions of low light.
[19:06:58.003] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> I detect both Erchius chemical signatures and human DNA in these entities. High likelihood of behavioural volatility predicted.

[19:12:38.556] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> Erchius readings have reached 94 rad. You are in peril. Your Peril level is currently 14,607 morts.
[19:12:47.838] [Info] Chat: <Esther Bright> Sorry about the AI, dear.
[19:12:55.272] [Info] Chat: <Esther Bright> Look at them; prolonged contact with the Erchius crystals seems to have denatured their very being! The poor creatures have lost themselves completely.
[19:13:35.836] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> Erchius readings have reached 101 rad. Your current Peril level is 18,472 morts...
[19:13:44.702] [Info] Chat: <Esther Bright> Hush! You're not helping.
[19:14:09.668] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> Conventional weapons have an estimated 0% chance of damaging the Erchius crystal. You are invited to devise another means of attack.
[19:15:17.633] [Info] Chat: <Esther Bright> Well done!
[19:15:24.748] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> There is enough Erchius here to fully repair the ship.
