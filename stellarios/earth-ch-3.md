The cabin was dark. Gilbert McInstay was searching for his space suit. He didn't like what "prepare for boarding" sounded like. **Where is it, where is it**, he thought over and over. Reaching into an unmarked supply bin, he felt some cloth. It was the space suits! 



For anyone that has never put on a space suit before,



Trying to record what had happened for the captain's log, Gilbert was typing furiously at his command console. Everything was locked down, and even as Gilbert typed, the screens he was facing darkened gradually until they were black.

Desperately, looking for something to log the message, he reached into his jacket and pulled out his comlink. He quickly turned it on and disabled its network functionality - **hopefully, if it's not on the network, it won't be shut down, like the other computers were**, he thought. Tapping at the screen, he swiped to the screen marked "Command" - it had just been installed onto his comlink by **insert first mate's name here**. He navigated to the app marked "Captain's Log" and began filming himself.



"Day 1 of my command" he began. "My name is Gilbert McInstay, currently the commander of the Scavenger Fleet. We were attempting to land on Earth when our command ship, including the previous commander, Opus *new last name - Opus only becomes Siridium in chapter 8", was apparently destroyed in a bright explosion. Alek Vicheva put me in command."

"Shortly after this, we received an extraterrestrial message. I am uploading its contents now. I will be boarding an extraterrestrial fleet's command module, as they commanded."



Opus put his comlink on the desk and the comlink automatically began the sequence that would upload its contents to the Scavenger network, which was located on the Scavenger's Planet of **__Charilia__**. He was pacing around his room when suddenly he heard a massive crash. He ran towards the source of the sound, outside the room. What he saw made his blood boil - almost literallly. 



Gilbert saw the starry sky, but not through a window. A massive hole had been blasted through the hull of his ship. He could see the exposed wires in the metre-sized hole, and if hadn't of  been wearing his space suit, he would have been dead. He only just managed to grab onto a handhold - a shelf - before he himself was wrenched out into space. But Gilbert's grip began to falter, and the force being applied was too strong. Gilbert was flung out through the hole at close to the speed of sound.

Gilbert's  eyes fluttered open. Bright dots flickered in front of his eyes, daring him to reach out and catch them. He tried to move his arms around, but they felt heavy and wouldn't move. It infuriated him. He saw foreign things, brilliant lights, computer consoles with strange, spidery lighting written all over them. He wanted to explore all around, to find out more about this alien landscape. 



The urge to get up overwhelmed all else. He sat there for what felt like days, not moving. He had no knowledge of where he was, or what his fate was - was he dead? Was this what it was like, to be dead? Just motionless, on the coloured canvas?



Suddenly, after what was really no time at all, his head cleared.  The bright flares faded away, and the room came into focus. The spidery writing that was on the computer closest to Gilbert had English letters, as well as German characters and Chinese numerals. There was a header that **was** written in a spidery font, and Gilbert couldn't read this. It said "Languages of the Earth".



Footsteps echoed throughout the room, and a 3 meter tall humanoid, with a large beard walked in. His skin was covered in circular tattoos. The tattoos shined bright blue on his skin, which was dark. The tattoos sent off an ominous feeling through Gilbert. They made him feel miserable and sick. 



The bearded humanoid said something, but the words were lost to Gilbert. His ears weren't working, and everything sounded bubbly and muted. Perhaps the humanoid realised this, for his tattoos suddenly stopped glowing, fading to black. The feeling inside Gilbert's ears left, and suddenly Gilbert understood what his companion was saying.



"My name is Starrix Lierge," the alien purred. He spoke with a soft growl, like a cat's. Of course, English is not his natural language, and in reality Starrix is speaking Miydlian. The drug that made Gilbert feel weird makes him understand Miydlian. "I am a member of the galactic parliament."



Gilbert knew all about the galactic parliament. What his people call the Milky Way is in fact the most densely populated galaxy in the universe, with literally thousands of intelligent species dotted all around the Milky Way. On their travels, they'd met many of those species, who all talked about the parliament, who had persecuted their people when they refused to join the galactic community. But he'd never met any member of the Galactic Commonwealth.



"Your planet was destroyed, along with your system," Starrix continued. He walked from the doorstep closer towards Gilbert, and Gilbert sat up. It felt amazing - to be able to move again. "Do you know about this?"



Gilbert quickly decided to say nothing at all. Why would the Commonwealth's fleet be at Earth right after it was destroyed? They'd never visited anywhere near Earth before. He'd heard stories - bad stories - from those aliens that the Scavengers had met after leaving Earth. The commonwealth offered with one hand, while snatching the natural resources of their planets with the other. The stories he'd heard left him in no doubt that the Commonwealth were responsible for the destruction of Earth. To say anything at all would give away possibly useful information. He'd been taken from his ship, drugged, and his planet had been destroyed. He did not trust Starrix - or the man that called himself Starrix.

Starrix left the creature and proceeded to the bridge. The translator must be faulty - but it had been designed by the best! Professor Eros was the foremost Miydlian scientist, and was loyal to the commonwealth. Starrix needed to find Eros, and ask him what was going on. He pulled out his comlink and navigated to the squad application. Eros's bubble popped up in the dorms. 

Right as Starrix was about to send a message to Professor Eros, he was interrupted by Menteth, a young recruit from the Kepler Army Barracks (KAB). Focused and eager, he had become the shadow of Starrix. But right now, Menteth was starting to get on his nerves.

"Sir?" Menteth inquired. 

"What is it?" Starrix replied testily. He didn't have time for this. 

Menteth took a step back. "The Premier has sent a communique. He needs to talk to you." At that moment, alarms started blaring. Menteth's aid, Roux [Emilien Roux] was beside Menteth in an instant. "Sir, we're under attack by pirates. We need to move the fleet!" exclaimed Roux. 

Menteth turned away and pulled out his comlink. Sure enough, there were pirates, bright red dots on the screen symbolising the attack cruisers. *How  curious*, he thought. *For them to know we're here they must have been from the Commonwealth...*

"Sir! They've bought an ion cannon, and they've almost finished charging it. We'll be gone if they strike us!" Roux pleaded. "What are your commands?"

Menteth snapped out of it. Pirates or commonwealth, if the opposition struck with the ion cannon they'd be long gone. Ion cannons are large weapons that fry a spaceship. It doesn't destroy it, but the cannon renders the ship inoperable - cannons, sublight drives and the hyperspace engines won't work, no matter who fired it. The fleet could then move in and dispose of them at will.

Before Menteth could make a decision, Starrix steppd up to Menteth. His antennae coupled with Menteth's sending soothing, calming messages. He gently forced Menteth away from Roux. 

"Start evacuation procedures, Roux. We've got what we came for, it's obvious the system's been destroyed. There - " 

"But, sir! The crew have calculated that the ion cannon will be within range within 5 minutes! It's currently bright red - when they're within range, they'll fire, and they won't miss." 

"Do you think I don't know this?" Starrix shouted. "But their fleet is composed of small, light fighters that will evade our cannons. Charge the hyperdrives, now! If we can't land a shot on them, how will we survive? We need to charge the engines, plot a course back to the Capitol, and send out a strike force to disable that ion cannon! Relay my orders to the crew. NOW!" Turning to Menteth, his hue turned from a dark green back to its usual greyish-blue. "Menteth. You need to get the civilian we captured. From what we know he's a great pilot. Get him into a ship, give him a command."

Menteth had been a fighter pilot before becoming an aide to Starrix. He knew how focused you had to be in combat. "Sir, with all due respect, what makes you think he'll fight for us and will be able to win? He didn't respond to you at all when you first talked to him."

*Interesting*, Starrix thought. *How does he know that?* "We need to know what he can do, why he was so important to them. And remember, we thought this would be a simple retrieve and explore mission - we bought practically no combat fighters with us! Give him THB-4. [THB-4 is a type of drug commonly given to troops that the Commonwealth Fleet had captured. It would put them in a dream-like state. They wouldn't know anything more than the fact that they're in a combat situation and would maintain their full abiities. It is ideal in this situation to get Gilbert to lead the assualt with those he considered enemies, as Gilbert would just be focussing on the battle. It was also a good depressant for those suffering from PTSD in the fleets.] And I can't believe we forgot this, but round up his other ships - we need to know who they are!" *After we're back at Midgard, I'll be able to take a long look and see how Menteth knows things that he has no right to no.* Was it possible  that there was a spy?

"Yes sir, I'll get the medicine and I'll notify Roux to move in on the rest of the ships. What's this alien's name?"

"Gilbert McInstay."

------

Gilbert woke up and rubbed his tired eyes. *It's time for me to do my duty,* he thought. His eyes blinked repeatedly as he got up from his sleep bunk, and he looked down to see a flight suit as his style of dress today.

He made his way out of the square room he had woken up in and made his way through the corridor into the mess hall. His legs operated on auto-pilot, and he knew instinctively where he was going, even though it was concerning him that he didn't consciously think where he was going to until he had left his room.

There is a situation where you may be consciously thinking something, for example "I've got a doctors appointment at 3 pm", but at the *exact same time* another part of you may be thinking "I've got to leave very soon to get there." In these situations, there are 2 - and sometimes more - distinct voices that you can clearly understand. It was like this for Gilbert. His legs took him from his bunk into the mess hall, while he was thinking at the same time *Where am I going?* and *I hope I'm not late*. Gilbert would be able to take care of the fighters in his normal state of mind, but what about now?
