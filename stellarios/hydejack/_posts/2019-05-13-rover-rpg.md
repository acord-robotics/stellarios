  To practice computer science and increase my development skills, I'm going to
  be creating a text-based Role Playing Game. It's going to be created using
  Python, and can be found on
  [Gitlab](http://gitlab.com/irisdroidology/expert-goggles) &
  [Github](http://github.com/irisdroidology/expert-goggles/). The Expert Goggles
  repo is my practice games and apps.

# What is Pythons of Mars?
I've been interested in creating games for a while. Last year, I created a game called Haunted. It was a text-based role-playing game that was developed with Python 3. While I didn't finish it, it showed me what I could do. 

I had been skeptical on how cool a text-based game could be. And yes, they aren't something like Eve online, or SWTOR, but they are definitely something that, if developed well, can be just as fun and interesting - [A Dark Room](http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/) is a good example.

Pythons of Mars is another text-based game where you are a Mars Rover and you've got 2 missions:
* Find life
* Return home
There are plenty of cool mini-games, and it's looking really good. 

It will be part of [Stellarios](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=how+to+run+python+games+on+mobile).
