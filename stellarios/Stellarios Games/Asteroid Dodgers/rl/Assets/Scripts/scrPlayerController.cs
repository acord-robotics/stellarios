// Troubleshooting:

/* Making cubes deactivate w/ rigidbody. 
* At this point in the script (https://gist.github.com/IrisDroidology/76a7819716a67531cc6bd6c003cfcd49/revisions#diff-8e1c866683af6bbf910bb66fedd7816b), the pick up object is not removed.
*  Any body with a collider and a rigidbody (body = gameObject) is dynamic. If there is no rigidbody, but a collider attached, the Unity editor expects the gameObject to be STATIC.
*  However, by just adding a rigidbody, the cubes fall through the platform, as they are affected by gravity. Because they are triggers, they DON'T collide with the floor.
*  In the rigidbody section of the inspector for the "Pick up" prefab, I can disable gravity, however the cubes are still affected by other physics forces.
*  A better way to solve the problem is to make the prefab a "kinematic rigidbody." It will not react to physics forces, but it can be animated and move by its TRANSFORM.
