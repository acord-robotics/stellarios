# Star Sailors - Earthlings

The first book in the series, Earthlings started development in 2017. The current repositories that work on Earthlings are located at [Liam's Gitlab](http://gitlab.com/irisdroidology/star-sailors).

## The Book

The book is split into 10 parts - a prologue, 8 chapters, and an epilogue. 

* [Prologue](http://acord-robotics.github.io/starsailors/earth-prologue)
* [Chapter 1](http://acord-robotics.github.io/starsailors/earth-ch-1)
* [Chapter 2](http://acord-robotics.github.io/starsailors/earth-ch-2)
* [Chapter 3](http://acord-robotics.github.io/starsailors/earth-ch-3)
* [Chapter 4](http://acord-robotics.github.io/starsailors/earth-ch-4)

## The Game

The game will be a 3D game like Starbound, starting off with following the plot of Star Sailors, and then the player forging his own path.

* The development of the first Star Sailors game, a single-player game with a unique co-op function, is located at [The UnityBalls Repo](http://github.com/acord-robotics/unityballs)

### Unity Balls
* Repo is located at Github/IrisDroidology/Unityballs & Github/Acord-Robotics/Unityballs

### Game Occupations

* Infiniraid player
* Scientist
* Doctor

Infiniraid players can have other occupations. To start with it will be a story-line base gameplay.
