# Star Sailors Novel

Star Sailors began development in 2017, when I was 14. See the story [here](https://acord-robotics.github.io/starsailors/hydejack/2019-03-15-Star-Sailors-Plot/) or scroll down - 

Star Sailors is a book and game series that is written by the Star Sailors team. The game will be played online (via the [ACORD Website](http://acord.org.au)) and in the [ACORD App](http://acord-robotics.github.io/starsailors/droidos). There will be a number of games within the game, but the main game will be an online RPG where players start off in an unknown universe. 

The novel Star Sailors will be finished by May 2019, with "Rules of the Game" (the companion guide to the sport introduced in Star Sailors) coming in July-August, and will come in 2 different versions. [ACORD Members](http://github.com/acord-robotics) will get a special version with extra chapters and content (including the "White Arm").

Fremantle. The port of Western Australia. And until recently, a place I visited at least once a month (on the weekends) with my family. Whether it was for Pancakes at the Chalky's cafe in the morning, or a set of Spanish Donuts at San Churros, Fremantle was a time to walk and talk with the family (and recently, the dog, Elsie, who we insist on bringing with us for walks).

It was way, way back in 2017. I was in year 9 at the time, and I was part of the junior writing club. I was walking along Fremantle with my dad, and we were talking about what sorts of sport could be played in space. We came up with something called Space Ball, which I'll talk about in [a future post](http://acord-robotics.github.io/starsailors/hydejack/2019-03-16-space-ball/). That gave me the idea to write another science fiction story set in space.

### Another Sci-Fi Story?

Yes, over the years I've started - but never finished - many sci-fi stories. They've been about colonizing planets and protecting the Earth from an alien invasion. If you'd like to check them out, check out my [writing repo.](http://irisdroidology.github.io/writing-repo/). 

### In Orlando, Florida (2019)

On the 23rd of December, 2018 (funnily enough, it was the 3rd ACORD Birthday) I touched down in New York at the JFK International airport. On the 2nd of January (2019), I touched down in Orlando. We spent 3 days at Universal Studios and my mum and I went to Disneyworld. 

When my dad and I were having dinner at the hotel one night, I raised the topic of the book again, since he'd given me a few ideas originally. We came up with a cross-between of soccer and handball with jetpacks. This is all subject to change, so keep an eye out for the post about space ball which is coming out soon.

### Today

Today I'm attempting to write one chapter a week. I've finished chapters 1 & 2 as well as the prologue. The entire novella outline is complete as well.

Sequels:

1. Star Sailors (Earthlings) - 2019
2. Star Sailors (The Round Ball) - 2019 or 2020 (see below)
3. Star Sailors (The final conflict) - 2020 or 2021 (see below)

We're also going to have a few spin-off novels.

1. Star Sailors (Rules of the Game) - 2019 or 2020 (see below)
2. Star Sailors (Galactic Map) - 2022 (see below)
3. Star Sailors (The RPG) - 2025+ (see below)
4. More coming?

### The Round Ball

This episode of Star Sailors will be about a death at the Space Ball (the name of this game will change) and the race to find the culprit.

### The final conflict 

Note: The name of this episode will change

Opus leads the Midgard Legacy in the final battle against the Darkness.

### Rules of the Game

The encyclopedia and history of Space Ball

### Galactic Map

The map of every planet, moon, star system and colony in the galaxy, as well as short bios.

### The RPG

A guide to playing the RPG. Released every year.
