# Objectives of Infiniraid
To get more goals than the opposition

# Equipment for players
* Jetpack
* Wearables?

## Jetpack
* Different eggs can charge jetpack?

# How the game works
* Each team has a nest of "eggs" that they protect
* The opposition tries to steal these eggs
* Once they steal the eggs, they evade the opposition
* The players with the eggs have to try to hatch them by throwing them to each other. Different eggs have different times to spawn. They have to make sure they don't give up the eggs

# Types of players
* Collectors - collect the eggs
* Retrievers - chase the chasers
* Defenders - protect the eggs
* Throwers - throw the eggs
* Shooters - shoot the alien creatures
* Other defenders -  defend against other creatures

To-Do: Add these to-dos to issues, new names for players, more to come, punishments if "throwers" don't pass the ball to the shooters in time or get "tackled" by retrievers

# Example of gameplay
## Teams
