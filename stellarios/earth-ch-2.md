title: Star Sailors Earthlings - Chapter 2
---

Starrix Lierze, the Miydlian Fleet Commander, was not used  to losing. Whether it was his rank or any of his soldiers, Lierze very rarely lost. That was why he’d been named the Fleet Commander for the Miydlians. For the past 2 years, he’d scoured the galaxy for life-giving planets in conservation zones, and he’d found Earth, a planet roughly the same size as Midgard – in fact, it had almost exactly the same physical properties as Midgard. Earth had looked like a planet that had intelligent life, and there were also other planets and moons in the same system that could be home to life as well. When he’d become Fleet Commander, he’d asked the Chancellor, Jayin, if would be allowed to send a mission to the Sol system, however, due to the ongoing crisis in the galactic parliament in regards to the Keplernians requesting full representation, Jayin had not believed another conquest had been in order.



Last month, Starrix’s friend, Lens Zaev, had been accepted as senator for the planet of Icon. Lens was an unusual Iconite – while he wasn’t very tech-savvy, he was definitely a lot more comfortable around technology than most of his people. The Iconites were a group that loved a good fight and a conquest, and immediately after his admission Starrix had walked over and told Lens about Earth.



2 weeks ago, the Galactic Parliament had convened in a special session, thanks to Lens. The 230 members of parliament had all voted on the matter, and 187 of them had voted yes. The members of parliament were all one of 6 species, however they had been spread out over 230 planetary systems, each organised into star systems and then into stellar neighbourhoods.



After this win in parliament, Chancellor Jayin had told Starrix to get the fleet ready. And here he was, waiting for further commands. After the disappearance of the Earth, he’d contacted the Chancellor with the news. Disappointed, Jayin was now mentioning the matter in the parliament, over 34,000 light years away…

-“And as you can see, senators, at 0315 this morning Commander Lierze noticed a brilliant flash of light in the Sol Star System. After this occured, the entire star system had disappeared. However, if we zoom in on a photo taken at 0312, we see a small ship, similar to a scavenger ship that was recovered 18 months ago in the same sector. We have to assume one of 2 things: either the inhabitants of Sol are somehow linked to the scavengers, or the scavengers are responsible for the disappearance of an entire system.”



For a moment, no-one spoke. Then the senator for Epitome spoke up – “Jayin, it seems we have been given an opportunity. Starrix has an entire fleet, we only saw 3 fighters in that clip. And as for the scavengers having the ability to destroy an entire system? Scavengers are a highly disorganised people who fight in small groups to sustain them for another day. They don’t fight wars and they don’t have the money or the power to do what you’re thinking.”



Applause followed this statement – most of the senators shared a common dislike of the Scavengers. “Perhaps the good senator of Epitome has made a valid argument. However, what about the actual inhabitants? While it is true that there was no proof of intelligent life, an entire system that had 3 habitable planets, all covered in green and being at least 4 billion years old would have a high chance to have intelligent life?”



The senator for Thulnore, a recently admitted planet, made his first speech since being elected: “It seems there is no intelligent life anywhere in the Chancellor’s box, either. I agree, there must be some sort of life in the Sol system. But why would they destroy their entire system? They aren’t in the parliament, and where would they have to go? If they were so technologically advanced that they could vaporize the system and be fine, we would have heard about them by now! What if the scavengers are really a military force inside a hijacked scavenger ship? Or what if the system was somehow destroyed and the scavengers showed up to salvage the remains?”



Jayin stood firm. “What if they have the technology to do what happened and the ability to hide it? Regardless, the point of this session is to discuss whether we should bring them in by force. You may cast your votes.”

“The results of this session are clear: 160 to 70 voted in favour of taking the scavengers in by force. We’ve contacted Starrix who has the name and callsign of the apparent 2IC of the so-called Scavenger Force, Gilbert McInstay. We will keep you informed.”



And so the senators got up from their boxes and moved outside.
