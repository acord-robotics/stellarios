# acord-robotics
The official ACORD Robotics (GENERAL) Repository

# What is this repo?

This repo is for all projects that aren't part of the following repos:

* Stellarios
* Star Sailors
* DroidOS (Archived)
* Acord News

An example of this would be stuff to do with members' personal journeys (for example, I'm going to be posting a lot of my computer science stuff here). While this stuff is beneficial for ACORD, it doesn't belong to any particular project.

If a part of this repo becomes a project (repository) in its own right, we will continue to update it on this repo as well, but the folder name will be changed to 'project_name_(archived)'.

This repository is also home to future ACORD posts, whether they go towards the portal, medium, our acord news blog, etc.

## ACORD Repositories

* [Stellarios](http://github.com/acord-robotics/stellarios) --- Currently archived until further notice, this repository houses the files for different versions of Stellarios (Windows, Mac, iOS, Linux, Android, etc.), as well as development news (part of the blog part) and links to download it. View the [blog here](http://acord-robotics.github.io/stellarios)
* [Star Sailors](http://github.com/acord-robotics/starsailors) --- All news to do with Droid Building, some Stellarios info, etc is here, as well as all Stellarios code (which is also on the Stellarios repo). View the [blog here](http://acord-robotics.github.io/starsailors)
* [ACORD News](http://acord-robotics.github.io/acordnews) --- Basically a public blog for ACORD
* [Mushlantis & ACORD Worlds](http://gitlab.com/acord-robotics)
* [Unity Games](https://gitlab.com/IrisDroidology/unityballs)
* [Star Sailors Draft](https://gitlab.com/IrisDroidology/star-sailors) - the draft of star sailors

## Future ACORD Repositories

* [App](http://github.com/acord-robotics/app) --- All code for the app
* [Website](http://github.com/acord-robotics/website) --- ACORD portal backup
* [Stellarios Learning](http://github.com/acord-robotics/sl) --- Our journey to learning how to develop
* Different types of droids (Companion, Scientific, etc). Each category will have a repository, as well as be in the Star Sailors Repo

Every repo will be copied into Star Sailors

# Orgzy Design
Orgzy Design, founded by our chairman in 2019, is a website and software development company. Orgzy work closely with ACORD and a number of our games (for example the Star Sailors game) will be based on games created by Orgzy. Orgzy are currently working on a game called "Asteroid Dodger", created in the Unity Game Engine. 

Orgzy can be thought of as a separate company that employs many ACORD programmers to create programs for ACORD. The programs created for ACORD will not be sold to the public, however Asteroid Dodger (the non-Star Sailors version) will not be private.

The code created for Asteroid Dodger will be used to create different apps/games for ACORD.

# Member Repositories

Our members have their own personal github accounts,  where they have repositories not related to ACORD but are still worth mentioning.

### Member Accounts

* [Liam Arbuckle](http://github.com/irisdroidology) --- Our Chairman & Co-Founder publishes content to do with his schooling as well as his computer science projects. These projects will help him when it comes to developing with ACORD (which he is also doing)
* [Farid](http://github.com/mfaridn03) --- Farid is a sort of fringe member of ACORD. He helps us with Python stuff

### Other companies

* [Orgzy Design](http://github.com/orgzy-design) --- Liam Arbuckle's web development company. 20% of the profits go towards ACORD

### Liam's Repositories

* [Games](http://github.com/irisdroidology/expert-goggles) --- A number of games created in numerous languages. One is a role playing game from the perspective of the Mars rover

## Stellarios Learning
* [Raspberry Pi](https://gitlab.com/acord-robotics/robodev/s2rd-raspberry-pi)
* [C++](https://gitlab.com/IrisDroidology/cpp-tutorial-vLnPwxZdW4Y)
