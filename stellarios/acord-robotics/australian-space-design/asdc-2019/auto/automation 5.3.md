Glossary:       Mbps (megabits per second)        - 1 million bits (or 1/8 million bytes) per second. Internet speed    ISPs - Internet service        provider          Types   of robots:   Health   & Medical   Note: Written by   Liam (on Zac's computer)   While location (as   in proximity to other humans) often has very little to do with loneliness and   depression (depression is most common in people that live in incredibly busy   cities. While this means that (in theory) our astronauts on board the station   won't get depressed, they probably will. Work and relationship struggles will   often create the seeds for depression. To deal with depression, anxiety, and   other mental illnesses, companion robots (androids, or droids) will be one of   the types of robots that will be seen on the station. These robots will be   physical, however they can also interact with a user's PDA):       PDA   The PDA will be   given to all inhabitants on board the station, and will provide access to the   internet, games and applications related to work, etc. It will be about the   size of a modern smart phone (with biometric locks and good-quality cameras,   running on Android)…..       As seen   to the right, the internet won't need to much "stuff" added or   changed to work in space (can someone please work on this?). As our   inhabitants will be long-term residents (especially considering there are   children on board), we will want to have good internet speeds. Apparently the   internet speeds are 600mbps on board the ISS (which is around 6 times the   maximum speed in Australia, so really fast), however we probably won't need   speeds that fast. Even 50-100 mbps (megabits per second) will work fine for   streaming video.        (Will   phone - as in calling and texting as we do on Earth using sms - work in   space?). A large reason why residents will get a PDA is for work. There will   be a number of jobs that will be required on board the station, and these   include teaching, maintenance, etc. The PDA will have an area (on the   homescreen, see image below) for work-related applications that will require   an additional password to get into (see security). These apps will vary based   on the occupation of the user.       ![10:51 AM  Extras  G! goo ](file:///C:/Users/arbuc/AppData/Local/Packages/Microsoft.Office.OneNote_8wekyb3d8bbwe/TempState/msohtmlclip/clip_image001.png)   Note: this image   is from an iOS folder, expect it to look more like how it would look on   Android, but another good example would be the Cydia tweak "Boxy"   (note: jailbroken iOS device needed). The work-related apps would be on a   regular homescreen, but they would be compressed like this. No folder   background is needed       See the   JOBS section below for more on this part of the PDA       Much   like humans on Earth,        Security   Much   like Samsung Knox's "Secure Folder" (see <https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/mobile-devices/what-is-the-secure-folder-and-how-do-i-use-it/>),   the applications for a user's occupation will be locked down inside the phone   - which means, even if the phone is locked, the user will still have to input   a password to unlock the apps. If the phone has just been turned on, you will   have to enter a password both to unlock the phone and to unlock the work part   of the phone - no biometrics (iris, face, eyeball, fingerprint, palm, voice,   hair, blood - basically anything that contains DNA, but probably not blood,   hair, saliva, or….better not finish that sentence actually). Once the phone   has been unlocked after being turned on (basically it has been decrypted, if   the phone has not been unlocked after being turned on it is 100% encrypted),   biometrics can be used.

If we were   communicating from mars or beyond, that would be a different story. The speed   of electromagnetic waves to the city will be around about 1 second or less,   so bytes will be sent and received quickly. However, like on the ISS, the internet speeds (in terms of   megabits/kilobits per second) will be slowed unless a "booster" or   modem-like device is created. According to the second reference listed, the   internet was at dial-up speeds back in 2015.       Okay, apparently I   was incorrect. The maximum bandwidth on the ISS (as of December 2016   according to Techcrunch) is 300 mbps, which is faster than most ISPs.   Apparently when the internet speed/capacity was increased (doubled), it was   mostly due to terrestrial changes rather than the creation of new   infrastructure or whatever on the ISS.       According to   space.com (2010), NASA increased the speed of space communications (to probes   and rovers) by fusing 3 aged communication networks into 1 single, more   efficient network, improving communication speeds by up to 50 times. Note:   this doesn't increase how fast the signal arrives from the probe to Earth (or   vice-versa), however it increases how fast messages can be coded and decoded   (as well as increasing file size to accommodate large photos and even   videos).    The original   networks had not had an upgrade since 1990. Previously, NASA created networks   based on the requirements of each specific mission, however now (after 2010?)   the network was updated to be unified and to work with all missions.
