# Operators - What are Operators & Different types of Operators

# What are Operators?
# An Operator performs a function between 2 operants, for example:

additionOperator = 5 + 6 # sets the value of the INTEGER VARIABLE "additionOperator" to 11, or 5+6

# Types of Operators
    # Assignment Operator
    # Arithmetic Operator
    # Relational Operator
    # Logical Operator


        # Assignment Operators  
        # Assigning a value to a variable, for example
assignmentOperator = "string" # the assignment operator in this case is the equals sign, on column 20


        # Arithmetic Operators
        # Addition (+), Multiplication (*), Subtraction (-), Division (/), Modulus (%)
myModulus = 5 % 2 # sets the value of the variable "myModulus" to the remainder of 5 divided by 2

        # Relational Operators
        # To compare values (of variables...)


        # Logical Operators
        # Combination of relational operators
        # "And" operation, + "or" operation

# Different Types of Operators
    # Assignment Operator
totalScore = 60 # sets the value of the variable "totalScore" to an integer value of 60
print(totalScore) # prints the value of the variable "totalScore", in this case 60


    #Arithmetic Operators
# Addition
#     
2 + 2 # The addition sign (+) is the arithmetic operator in this function, the result of this function is "4"

# Division

10/5 # This prints "2.0", which is a floating point number
    # to print the division as an integer,
10//5 # This prints "2"   

# Modulus
10%3 # This prints the remainder of 10 divided by 3, which is 1



# Relational Operators
    # Returns BOOLEAN values - TRUE or FALSE 
    # Less than (<) & less than or equal to (<=)
lowNumber = 5
bigNumber = 6
if 5 < 6
    print("lowNumber is smaller than bigNumber ")    

    # Greater than (>) & greater than or equal to (>=)
    # Basically same as lines 60-63

    # Double Equal (==)
5 == 5 # The double equals sign is used to differentiate from an assignment operator

    # Not equal to (!=)

# Logical Operators 
    # "And" operator
    # Both statements have to be true 

5>10 and 5<10 # The console returns "false" as one of these statements is false
5>4 and 4>3 # The console returns "true" as both statements are true

if 5>4 and 4>3
    print("These statements are true") # Requires both statements to be true to print the command to the console. As both statements are true, the command would be printed

    # "Or" Operator
    # One or both operators has to be true

5>10 or 5<10 # The console returns "true" as one of these statements is true
5<10 or 10>5 # Thre console returns "true" as one or more (2) of these  statements is true

    # "Not" Operator
    # Opposite output
not 2<5 # This returns "true" via the console because  2 is not greater than 5    

# Exercise Problems
addTwo = 2 + 2

2 + 3 * 4 # Using BIMMDAS, I get the value of 14, which is correct

5>3 and 3>0
