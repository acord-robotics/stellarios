# Closer Look at Numbers
# Lecture: https://www.udemy.com/course/python-masterclass-for-beginners/learn/lecture/13270006#overview

# Integers
integer = 5

# Floating point
floatnumber = 5.0
float = 5.1
negfloat = -5

# Complex Numbers
complexnumber = 5 + 5j

# Printing Numbers
print(type(float)) # determines what type of number the variable "float" is, in this case it would output "float" - "Class Float"
print(integer) # prints the value of the number-integer variable "integer" to the console - prints "5" to console

# Number Operations
number1 = 1
number2 = 2
number1n2 = number2 + number1 # sets the value of the variable "number1n2" to the value of "number1" & "nummber2" added - 1 + 2 = 3

number1 = 1.0
number2 = 2
number1x2 = number1 * number2 # this is now a float, as at least one of the variables (number1) is a floating point number variable
print(number1x2) # prints 2.0
