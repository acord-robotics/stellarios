Q & A -- Introducing yourself
https://www.udemy.com/course/python-masterclass-for-beginners/learn/lecture/12851022#questions
Hi  there! My name is Liam Arbuckle, I'm from Australia, and I'm enrolled in this course to learn more about Python. I have a little bit of experience in Python - including lists, tuples, and a little bit of pygame, however I don't have much experience in putting those tools to real world use. This course looks like a way to fix that!

# First Program - Hello World
msg = "Hello World!"
print(msg) # even though the variable "msg" is a string, since we are inputting variable there is no need for quotes
            # prints the value of string variable "msg" to the console
