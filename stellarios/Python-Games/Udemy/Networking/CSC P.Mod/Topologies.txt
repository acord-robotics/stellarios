What is a topology?
	• The ways nodes in networks are connected together

Bus Topology
	• Early ethernet networks used a bus structure
	• Modern ethernet networks use a star bus structure (hybrid) 
	• Every device and computer is connected to a single cable 
	• Linear bus topology - 2 end points 
	• Features: 
		○ Every device is connected to one cable
		○ Transmits data in one direction
	• Advantages:
		○ Cost effective
		○ Low amount of cable required (compared to other networking topologies)
		○ Used in small networks
		○ Easy to understand and set-up
		○ Easy to expand (join 2 cables together)
	• Disadvantages:
		○ If cable fails, network fails
		○ If network is heavy performance decreases
		○ Limited cable length
		○ Slower than ring topology
Ring Topology
	• Each computer is connected to another computer
		○ (Benzene shape)
		○ 2 neighbours for each device
	• Features:
		○ A number of repeaters are needed (as data has to travel through all the nodes from the first computer/device to the desired node)
		○ Unidirectional transmission
			§ However, bidirectional transmission can be done by having 2 connections between each device
			§ Benzene double bonding (eg)
			§ Dual Ring Topology
		○ Dual Ring Topology - 2 ring networks are formed
			§ 1 can be a backup
		○ Data is transferred bit by bit in a sequential manner
	• Advantages:
		○ Cheap to install and expand
		○ Network is not affected by high traffic or adding more nodes 
	• Disadvantages:
		○ Troubleshooting is difficult
		○ Adding/deleting nodes disturbs the network activity
		○ Failure of one computer disturbs the whole network
Mesh Topology
	• Both Wi-Fi & Bluetooth are being upgraded to support Mesh Networking
	

Star Topology

Hybrid Topology
	• Modern Ethernet Networks use a hybrid topology structure (star bus)
