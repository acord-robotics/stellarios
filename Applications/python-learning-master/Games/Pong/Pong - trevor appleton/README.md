Ok so imagine the year is 1973. All the talk is about a new arcade game which has been released by Atari. That game is called Pong.



  Now it might not seem much of a game by today's standards, but it was a massive hit in its day... or so I am told.

But don't be deceived, although a simple game, Pong covers a wide range of aspects of computer game programming. There is movement, control, collision detection, scoring, artificial intelligence. Its all in there!
    Being able to program Pong is a doorway to being able to program a lot of other games.

However once you start playing Pong you might find less time to program, as it is quite addictive!

We are going to program pong using Python and Pygame.

I will be using Python 2.7. For those programming on a Raspberry Pi this will already be installed. Just ensure you click on the IDLE icon and not the IDLE3 icon. If Python 2.7 is not installed on your system you may have to install it from the Python website, just follow the link below.  

https://www.python.org/downloads/



Pygame is a basically a set of modules which are designed to help you write computer games. We will be using some of these modules throughout this tutorial. You will need to install Pygame, which is free, and runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX (plus many more operating systems!)
If you are programming on a Raspberry Pi, again this is already installed, if not to download Pygame go to the Pygame website.

I cannot rate them highly enough! After several false starts with other books, it was these resources that taught me Python.

I am going to break this game down into stages, which reflect how I developed it. I hope this will show you that when you look at the game as a whole it can seem daunting, but when broken down it is just made up of many easy parts.

Stage 1 - Create a blank screenStage 2 - Draw the arena, the paddles and the ballStage 3 - Move the ball aroundStage 4 - Check for a collision with all edgesStage 5 - Move the players paddleStage 6 - Move the computers paddle with Artificial IntelligenceStage 7 - Check for a collision with the paddlesStage 8 - Add a scoring systemStage 9 - Finally we will look at methods to increase the speed for slower computers

First of all, as promised, I will show you the whole code. At this stage don't worry if you don't understand it all. I would suggest having a read through it and seeing what parts you understand and which you don't.
