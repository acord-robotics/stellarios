# Python - Hello World

*From LearnPython.org*

https://www.learnpython.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21

* The "print" directive prints out a line
* It also includes a newline (unlike in the C programming language)

A string can be written in Python like this:

```python
print("Hello World")
# This would print out "Hello World" to the console, without the quotation marks
```

The exercise can also be seen in Github/IrisDroidology/Python-Learning, go to the Master Branch, then LearnPython.org, then HelloWorld!.py
