# Lists - LearnPython.org

* Lists - similar to ***arrays*** (variables which can hold more than one value)
* Lists can contain any type of variable
* They can contain as many variables as you want

A list can be built like this:

```python
mylist = []
mylist.append(1)
mylist.append(2)
mylist.append(3)
print(mylist[0]) # prints 1
print(mylist[1]) # prints 2
print(mylist[2]) # prints 3

# prints out 1,2,3
for x in mylist:
    print(x)
```
