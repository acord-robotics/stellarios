# Variables & Types

*From LearnPython.org*

https://www.learnpython.org/en/Variables_and_Types

* Python is **object oriented**
  * It is not **statically typed**
  * This means you do not need to declare variables before using them
  * You also do not need to declare their type

## Types of Variables - Numbers

### Integer 

* Integer - whole number

An example of setting up an integer and printing it:

```python
myint = 7 # this sets the value of "myint" to 7
print(myint) # this prints the value of "myint", in this case 7
```

### Floating point number

* Floating point number - number with decimal point

**Can be a whole number!**

```python
myfloat = 7.0
print(myfloat)
myfloat = float(7)
print(myfloat)
```



### Strings

* Defined with either double or single quotation marks ('' or "")
* It is better to use "" as you can then use apostrophes in the string

```python
# Example of String variable in Python
mystring = "This is a string"
print(mystring) # prints the variable of "mystring"
```

### Operators

* Operators (+, -, *, /) can be used

Example:

```python
string1 = "This is a string"
string2 = "that is half-complete"
print(string1 + string2) #prints the value of "string1" & "string2", in this case "This is a string""that is half-complete". Note that there is no space between string1 and string2
```
