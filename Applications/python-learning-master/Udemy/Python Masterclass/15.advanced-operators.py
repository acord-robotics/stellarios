# Exponentials
ten = 10
ten2 = 10 ** 2 # Exponential 10^2
ten3 = 10 ** 3

# Division
division10 = ten // 4 # sets the value of "division10" to 10/4 = 2.5, however it is whole number: 2

# +=
number1 = 1 # sets the value of "number1" to "1"
number1 += 1 # adds 1 to "number1"
number1 = number1 + 1 # Basically the same as the above line (line 15), just a different way of writing it
