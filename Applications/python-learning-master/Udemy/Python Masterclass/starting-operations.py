# Starting Of Operations
# Lecture: https://www.udemy.com/course/python-masterclass-for-beginners/learn/lecture/13270000#overview

# Integer Operations

number = 50
number2 = 20
number3 = 10 + 20
number4 = number + number2
number5 = number + 10
numberMultiply = number * number5

# String Operations
stringvariable = "aaa"
stringvariable2 = "bbb"
stringvariable3 = stringvariable + stringvariable2 # Concatenation of strings, outputs "aaabbb" to the console

stringvariable4 = "..."

"""
Right now, we cannot add an integer variable and a string together - need to convert int to string variable
However, we can multiply a string by an integer variable or a number (see lines 10, 7 of this file to see what I mean)
"""

a = "a"
number = 5
repeata = a * number # Sets the value of STRING variable "repeata" to "aaaaa", or the value of variable "a" repeated the number of times that is seen in the integer variable "number"
print(repeata) # Prints "aaaaa" to the console as an output
