# Casting
# Integer to string
myInt = 1
myStringInt = str(myInt) # changes from integer to string

# Integer to float
myInt = 1
myFloatInt = float(int) # 1 --> 1.0

# String to int
myString = 1
myIntString = int(myString)

# Concatenation can be done with casting

# Other Stuff
float = 1.0
print(type(float)) # determines what type of number the variable "float" is, in this case it would output "float" - "Class Float"
