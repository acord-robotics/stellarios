# List Loop
companies = ["ACORD", "Google", "Microsoft", "IBM", "Apple", "Samsung"]
example = "Example"

# Print each index
    # We could do this:
print(companies[0])
print(companies[1]) #....

    # Or we could do this, using a loop, which repeats the thing inside the loop until something set is true, or false
for c in companies: # start for loop            # c for companies    
    print(c) # Every element in the list "companies"


# String loop
for x in example: # "example" is the name of a string variable
    print(x) # one character in each line, each character from "example" variable # Each character printed becomes the new value of "x"
    until x = p

# More printing
print(c)  # prints last element in the list "companies" as the last value assigned was the last value in the list - in this case "Samsung"
