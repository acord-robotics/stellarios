# Easy - Declare a variable without breaking any of the rules
variable = 70 # integer variable

# Medium - Declare this variable “break = 50”. Which rule does it break ?
# It uses the Python keyword "break"

# Hard - Make changes to these variables so that they no longer break the rules to
define a variable

phoneNumber = 12345 # integer variable, original name was phone$phoneNumber
Name = "Benny" # Original name for variable was 123 name
