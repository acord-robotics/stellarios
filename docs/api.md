Jira projects:
* [DSP](https://signal-kinetics.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/DSP/boards/5) - Data science (general), also python-based webapps, machine learning, python libraries, apis
* [RAPIA](https://signal-kinetics.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/RAPIA) - REST Apis specifically for Arcadia - links in with a sprint for DSP
* [UPK](https://signal-kinetics.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/UPK) - General unity stuff for first part of first game (soon will create a new project for Unity with sprints, proper use of labels and connections between projects, as well as folders for projects) 

Repository Map

# Django
## Django-Rest
### Example
Trying out the django-rest api to see how it differs and can offer anything that the Flask restful can't (as well as django vs flask in general, but since this is mainly for the game engine it's revolving around the APIs). 

[`django/django-rest/example`](https://github.com/signal-k/api/tree/main/django/django-rest/example)

# Flask1
Submodule for [`Github/Signal-k/flask1](https://github.com/signal-k/flask1)

# Heroku
## Example
Attempting (and so far failing) to get Heroku to deploy a simple Flask application

# Flaskrest
Includes PyGithub, and a simple Flask API
