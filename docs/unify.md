# Plot
Start as an astronaut (human) on a planet. Planets in the solar system you're in are starting to be "disintegrated" (aka being moved, see the Star Sailors story) and you need to gather as much alien DNA as possible. You travel from planet to planet using a ship that you repair with the help of your new alien friends and once you get aliens from each of the 5 biospheres on each planet (with a shared history between all life in the ecosystems this is enough data to retrieve) you need to mine asteroids and other space anomalies to prepare for a jump to the Galactic Capital, Midgard, where you will bring the aliens for safekeeping and bring word of the destruction of planets (by sentient forces like gravity and electromagnetism).
