# State of development
We've been following a RAD-style model for the development due to the recent Hashnode Amplify Hackathon to rapidly bootstrap the application, with [Liam Arbuckle](https://sk.acord.software/larbuckle) & [Arthur Passos](mailto:arthur.passos@skinetics.tech) taking charge of the development. 
It's currently being developed on the [Signal Kinetics](https://github.com/signal-k) Github organisation with a Jira project management backend.
