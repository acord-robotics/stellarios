Jayin >> "Is this room secure?" (It wouldn't be the first time that they'd been eavesdropped upon)

Nox >> (Nox looked behind him to make sure that the holograms were all gone) "I can't confirm that, but it doesn't matter as to send in a fleet we would have to notify Parliament anyway," [he pointed out]. (He moved back to his seat and bought out his comlink). "As you can see, "

At Freo Lit on Friday, 9.8.19, I did some writing for Chapter 4, as well as a small bio on Starrix Lierge: The photos can be found here: https://photos.app.goo.gl/AXxjdiWkjUHvTxiL8

Jayin stood with his arms clasped behind his back. He faced a jumble of holograms; holograms of his advisors and his political allies. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Orson, his cousin. It seemed like so long ago that he had last gone hunting with Orson, before he had become a politician, 18 standard years ago. For someone like Jayin, who lived for hundreds of years, this was a very, very short time ago. He sighed. Orson had been so young back then. So naive and so full of ideas. Spend too much time in politics, and the result of that sat before him. Many bribes and moments of treachery later, and Orson was no longer the idealist that had been driven to join Jayin's team. He was something else. But he was still loyal to Jayin, unlike many of his other advisors.

Jayin shook himself back to the present as his chief political advisor, Lorian Nox, approached him and put a data card onto his table. He really needed to see his doctor. His pills weren't working. Getting distracted in this business was a weakness that others could exploit. And, he thought to himself grimly, probably have already.

Nox, who was a Keplernian, spoke in his gravelly voice. "Jayin, we've heard that Starrix's fleet are in trouble. They weren't able to complete their message before their communication was terminated, but our scanners have shown some sort of pirate group in the area. A pirate group that was completely unidentifiable via our scanners."

Jayin struggled to understand what this meant. "Are you saying that they are an unknown species?" Such species weren't uncommon. They were either truly unknown - 'now those were rare' - or they weren't members of parliament, meaning they didn't recognize the laws or ways of the majority of the galaxy - 'the civilized part' thought Jayin grimly. Attacks by the latter group were common - only last month the Juganoth Mining Corporation had lost its prospecting fleet around the gas planet Vao-73. He'd spent ages trying to clean that mess up, and he didn't want that to happen again.

Nox pointed to the data card that he had put on Jayin's desk, and as Jayin slipped it into his datapad he continued. "I don't think any species is truly unknown," Nox said slowly. "They produce enough waste products on their home planets that even if they aren't intelligent, so we know where everyone is. But we've never seen this species and we've never communicated with them. We knew they were there, but the sector they were in is classed as a conservation area by Parliament, and we had other problems to deal with. We had no reason to believe that they'd traveled outside of their system, so we took a note of it and moved on."

A video on Jayin's datapad was about to play, but Jayin paused it. "So we know that this species has the ability to travel through hyperspace, but we do nothing about it? How far have they traveled?" 'Do they really know nothing about us? Could they have been spying on us?' Jayin thought to himself.

"Chancellor, I think you misunderstand. This group is very small, probably only a few hundred of them are around. They've communicated with the other intelligent species in their area, but we think - think - that they are the equivalent of merchants. We've mapped their movements in the past year, and there is no sign of them moving much further than 2000 light-years from their home planet, which isn't very far." Nox motioned towards the datapad that Jayin was holding, and Jayin unpaused the video. The video was actually a highly detailed render. The video zoomed in on a ship that was in orbit around a pale blue dot - 'is that their home planet?' before launching into hyperspace. The image zoomed out again, however this time it showed an entire galaxy - what the humans call the "Milky Way" - and a tag on where Jayin was. Another tag appeared labeled "target" - which Jayin assumed meant the group they were tracking. Bright lines crisscrossed a small distance around from the target tracker, with different colours - green, blue, red and yellow - forming a pattern of paint streaks on the galaxy. Jayin saw a solitary white line as well. Nox reached over Jayin's shoulder to tap on the datapad again, and the image on the pad zoomed in so that the tracker was in the center of the screen. "As you can see, Jayin, they have explored a large amount of their local neighborhood. The red streaks denote the journeys that they have undertaken by themselves, while the white streak denotes their first journey outside their system. They've been sending probes and manned missions throughout their system for almost two centuries now, and those are depicted with the yellow streaks. The blue streaks show our scouting ships that have tracked them, and the green streaks show the journeys that have been undertaken with other species - some of those are members of Parliament."

The graphic stopped playing and the screen on Jayin's datapad turned itself off automatically. Jayin stood up and paced around the room with his antennae whirling around wildly. He suddenly jumped in alarm. "Nox, Starrix's fleet have engaged with the pirate fleet," he announced dramatically. He was receiving a full stream of what was occurring through his antennae. All members of his species had the antennae, which were used for communicating emotions between each other in tightly-knit communities. His, however, had been modified by his trusty medical 'droid EssToo, so that he experienced all communications sent by his aides and officers towards his office. He banged his amphibious hands on the table. 'I really need a swim right now,' he thought to himself. 'I've spent too long inside this foreign environment'. "I've been told to expect a communications blackout within two minutes." 'This is what happens when you don't focus on the task at hand.!

"Sir, he's flying better than anyone else in the fleet!" Roux looked up from his data display in amazement. Around him, bright flashing lights that would have hurt the eyes of a human were active, alerting the bridge to the status of their attack fighters. Gilbert was working wonders out there in his ship, albeit in an unusual state. None of the consoles had been switched off, which showed that no ships - either friend or foe - had been destroyed. But only 30 pirate fighters of the original total of 100 were still moving. They'd all been disabled by something. Already the bridge commanders were debating what to do with those disabled ships. But Starrix wasn't joining in the celebrations.

"Roux, can we radio into his attack fighter and ask him what he's doing?" Starrix asked the aide, who shook his head.

"Negative, sir. But I can do something better sir. I know what he's doing - he's using their ion cannons against them!"

'Incredible', Starrix thought. 'The tool of your adversary is truly your greatest advantage.' "I need to see Professor Eros immediately about communicating with our guest. Can you bring him towards me?"

Menteth - 'where did he come from?' - appeared from a jumble of wires underneath a broken comstation. He shook his head as he said, "Professor Eros has been thought-linked to the human, and he can't communicate with us. His assistant, Tullo is monitoring him, and he is able to talk. He says he's got important information that he -" he looked at his datapad at the communique he had received - "can't let Eros find out about it for now." He turned his head back towards Starrix, and his neck gills started to flutter as if in a wind. "Do I have orders?" he asked Starrix.

"Roux!" The aide appeared immediately in front of Starrix. "Go find this Tullo. We need to talk."

The inventor looked up as two men in military uniforms stood in front of his door. "We need you to come with us, Tullo," one of them said, as the other cocked his stun blaster menacingly. "We're about to head into the Flux and before we do we need you to plot a course through it. And Starrix wants to see you as well."

Tullo bought himself to his full height. As a Keplernian, he stood almost half a metre taller than the military goons, who had been well trained and didn't shrink back. "Has Starrix received my message?" he asked calmly as he as he tied his hair back and submitted his datapad to the taller of the soldiers, who seemed to be in charge. "It is quite urgent that it is seen immediately." 

The soldiers ignored him, as Tullo expected them to. He followed them out the door of his messy workshop, past the half-finished electrical clutter that was his home away from home. They also ignored him as he bent down to secretly place 2 high-fidelity router speakers, which would re-route his discoveries to the command bridge, and to Starrix, before his room blew up and took the guards with it. Just a few more seconds...

"McInstay, fly back." 

Gilbert heard a voice in the back of his mind, the same voice that had been ordering him around since he'd awoken. They'd rushed him into a spacesuit, placed him into a spaceship which had launched out of the shuttle bay almost as soon as he was inside. He'd been flying around in a weird universe, full of bright lights and alien spaceships. Had Opus put him back in the training simulator? He'd have to tell him how good the simulators had gotten when he got out.

This went on for a few minutes, and he shot down starfighter after starfighter, which were then collected by more spaceships, the pilots rescued and captured. Gilbert wondered why the creators of the simulation had added that redundant part. This thought nagged at the back of his mind for the next few minutes

The entire fleet, under Starrix's command, jumped into the Flux/Hyperspace
