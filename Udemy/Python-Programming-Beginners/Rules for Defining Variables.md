# UDEMY - Rules for Defining Variables

* The variable name has to start with a letter or underscore

Example:

```python
a1 = "correct name"
print(a1) #this would print a variable, the variable can be set as it follows the rule listed above

_1 = "correct name" #This is also a correct name for a variable

1n = "incorrect variable name" #This creates a syntax error
```

* Variables are case-sensitive
* Reserved names cannot be variable names

## Reserved names

* print 
* Inbuilt function in Python with a specific purpose



## Special characters

* The only special character that can be used in a variable name is the underscore (_)
