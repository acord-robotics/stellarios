    (Earthlings & Cancrinites/Miydlians – the space ball team Cancri Scroobs (named after small rodents) – win the league)

# C7


    Opus is taken to the beings who "kidnapped" him
    Message from Opus to Starrix & Gilbert - what's going on
    This message says that Kepler will be destroyed as there is too much of the essence of a god-like being (i.e. he wasn't kept in check by the other beings/forces)
    Jayin demands that an army be deployed, this army fails
    Jayin is sacked as Chancellor because the army was defeated and Kepler was ‘destroyed’

# C8

    Opus reveals he knows who the force is and how to subdue it
    Pox Stekkol – Senator for Kepler – elected as emergency Chancellor
    Pox sends a strike team to the stronghold where Opus is
    Opus stands out in the ensuing conflict, awarded the province of Strilion, rescues the being who threatened the safety of the universe, reverses the changes so there is "less of him" (if there's too much of a force, it is bad - for want of a better word)
    Months go by, Opus discovers the Siridium star in his province, constructs his arm
