  DroidOS, the official operating system of ACORD Robotics, is undergoing a few
  changes at the moment. I'm going to be talking about the DroidOS Beta. I'm
  getting a new PC and a new phone over the next few weeks, so it will be a good
  chance to test out and develop DroidOS before released the public download.
  ACORD members can download DroidOS for free. For non-ACORD members, it will be
  $5 per repo - iOS, Android, Windows are currently being developed.

I'm just going to jump straight into this post.

# My new phone - Samsung Galaxy S8 (2017)

Specs:
- 5.8 inch display + 4k resolution
- Octacore Snapdragon 835 (US market), Exynos 8895 (international market)
- Android 9.0 Pie
- 4 GB Ram
- 64 GB storage + expandable storage (up to 256gb)
- 3,000 mAh battery
- 8 MP front-facing camera, 12 MP rear-facing camera
- Biometrics: Fingerprint sensor, Iris scanner, Face scanner
- USB-C Charging
- Samsung Dex

On the 29th of March, I'm getting a new phone - the Samsung S8. Released in 2017, I think it is the best value phone over $500 (AUD). While companies like Oppo (with the A73)release phones for half the price that are genuinely good phones, I believe if you're willing to spend a bit more the S8 is a great buy.

## What will my PC be for?
I earnt my computer for a good report card over 2018 and a good start to 2019. I'll be using it for gaming, coding, designing robots and writing. 

While my PC will not be the most powerful I could afford, I don't need much more. I'll be playing very minimal games, with the most graphics-intensive games being Just Cause 3 and Space Engineers.

I'll be doing my coding for Star Sailors as well as writing some of it on the PC. Finally, the designing of robots for ACORD will be the other thing I use it for.

## Games I'll be playing
- Just Cause 3
- Starbound
- Minecraft (PC & Windows 10 edition)
- Bluestacks
- Space Engineers
- Take on Mars
- No Man's Sky
- Astroneer
- Universe Sandbox
- Master of Orion (Deluxe)
- Eve Online
- Signs of life
