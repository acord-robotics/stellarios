description: ACORD has decided to move on from the Aardvark theme by Ghostpool, which we've used since March this year. We've moved to the Olympus theme, which is a very modern-looking template for Buddypress sites. Buddyboss (2016-17) >> Buddyapp (2017) >> Thrive (2018-19) >> Aardvark (2019) >> Olympus + Youzer (2019)

I was looking around for some good buddypress themes just out of interest on Wednesday or Thursday, and I came across a theme called "Olympus". Now, I had no real intentions of changing the theme of the ACORD website from Aardvark - it had, after all, served me pretty well. The only real problem I had with Aardvark was the header menu, but that could easily be fixed, and the other members of ACORD had no problem with it.

However, that all changed when I came across the Olympus theme.

This theme uses a plugin called [Youzer](http://youzer.kainelabs.com). The cool thing about this plugin is that it gives a complete overhaul of the traditional buddypress structure and layout, and adds a number of really awesome things as well:

* New buddypress tab - overview. This is where users can set widgets for their profile, for example portfolio or about me
* 14 different header styles
* Completely customizable navigation
* Much more - check out [their website](http://youzer.kainelabs.com) to see more

I'd tangled with Youzer in the past when I was using the Thrive theme by Dunhakdis, however it had become a bit of an eyesore with Thrive contrasting strongly with it. I'd contemplated going back to it with Aardvark, however the Aardvark theme was fine without it.

But a theme built *for* Youzer? That was something that I'd never seen before, and *definitely* something worth looking into. This isn't a review of the Olympus theme - I'm happy to post that on my personal blog - [check it out](https://irisdroidology.github.io/portfolio/index.html).
