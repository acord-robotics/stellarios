Resuming Mesaville (2017)

## 2019 Plans for Minecraft
As you may have seen in my previous post, we're starting a new Minecraft season. It will be played in Minecraft Bedrock, on my new gaming PC. We've started in a mushroom biome, which is on the edge of an ice spikes biome with a frozen village as well. 

## First video
I've recorded the first video but have not yet edited it. Unfortunately, the audio quality was not very good recording the gameplay so I've muted it completely, however there is still an intro I recorded later that is better-looking. It will hopefully be coming out by the 7th of April.

## The plan
There are a lot of cool tunnels and shafts in my mushroom biome, and I want to do something I've never really done before - create a network of abstract builds and bases following the designs of the naturally generated structures. Although it will be quite challenging it will be rewarding when we're done. I'm also hoping to create a village and a floating island base. Rendog's Hermitcraft Season 5 and TheNeoCubest's cave base will provide a major inspiration.

I'll be playing with a few cool people, including:

* Dylan Vekaria, who came up with my new Youtube name, Limology (after Droidology). However, I'm still gonna call myself LimoArduino in robotics videos
* More to come

I aim to kill the ender dragon legitimately by December this year, but we'll hopefully have had a lot done by then, including:

* A village with at least 25 villagers, including 1 of each type
* At least 20 episodes
* Mini-worlds - sort of dioramas featuring my previous worlds. Hidden behind a secret redstone door
* Cool redstone devices - including an automatic sorting system
* Curiosity Rover & R2-D2 model
* R2-D2 pixel art (on the mushroom biome, which will be visible on the map)

## Thanks for all the support!! Limo XD (Droidology)
