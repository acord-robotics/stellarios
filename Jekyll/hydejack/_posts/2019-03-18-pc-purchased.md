Last night, I purchased my PC. It has an AMD Ryzen 5 2600 2.3 ghz CPU, an Nvidea GTX 1050TI graphics card, a Deepcool White RPG Midtower Case, a Samsung monitor, and much more.

## Minecraft Season 1
Our 2019 Minecraft Season will be in a mushroom biome once again. We're going to attempt to have beaten the ender dragon by December. The original Mushlantis V2 will be retired, however it will continue to be played by ACORD members. We would like to take this time to thank the original Mushlantis seed.

### What's the plan?
Because of copyright issues with the term droid, I will be changing my name on Youtube to LimoArduino, showing my nickname (Limo) and a well-known and useful robotic part (the arduino). 

We'll be starting in a mushroom biome, which is connect to an Ice Plains Spike biome. The video will come out by the 7th of April. 

I want to construct a village and an underwater base, but we'll start with making a simple base on the mushroom biome. I will be constructing an automatic chest sorter room which will go across many levels, and there will be a range of cool redstone devices. We're also going to attempt to build "mini-worlds" in Minecraft, which will be dioramas of the original worlds that I started on Youtube.
