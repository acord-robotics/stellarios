## Applications
To develop code (especially using the Python & C++ programming languages), you need a compiler and a text editor:
* [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Visual Studio is great for all languages and is currently being used by myself and ACORD
* [Code Blocks](https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/17.12/Windows/codeblocks-17.12mingw-setup.exe/download) - Codeblocks is a compiler for C++ that is recommended by ACORD and freecodecamp
